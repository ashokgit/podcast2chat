- I think it's actually
not that hard to imagine

we are the only civilization
in the galaxy right now.

- [Lex] Living?

- Yeah, that's currently extent.

But there may be very many
extinct civilizations.

If each civilization has a
typical lifetime comparable to,

let's say AI is the demise of our own,

that's only a few hundred years

of technological development
or maybe 10,000 years

if you go back to the
Neolithic revolution,

the dawn of agriculture, you know,

hardly anything in the cosmic time span.

That's nothing. That's
the blink of an eye.

And so it's not surprising
at all that we would happen

not to coexist with anyone else,

but that doesn't mean
nobody else was ever here.

And if other civilizations
come to that same

conclusion and realization,
maybe they scour

the galaxy around them,

don't find any evidence for intelligence,

then they have two options.

They can either give up on
communication and just say,

well, it's never gonna happen.

We just may as well just, you know,

worry about what's happening
here on their own planet.

Or they could attempt communication,

but communication through time.

- The following is a conversation

with David Kipping, an
astronomer and astrophysicist

at Columbia University,
director of the Cool Worlds lab.

And he's an amazing
educator about the most

fascinating scientific
phenomena in our universe.

I highly recommend you
check out his videos

on the Cool Worlds YouTube channel.

David quickly became one of
my favorite human beings.

I hope to talk to him many
more times in the future.

This is a Lex Friedman Podcast.

in the description.

And now, dear friends,
here's David Kipping.

Your research at Columbia
is in part focused

on what you call cool
worlds or worlds outside

our Solar System, where
temperature is sufficiently

cool to allow for moons,

rings and life to form and
for us humans to observe it.

So can you tell me more about this idea,

this place of cool worlds?

- Yeah.

The history of discovering planets outside

our Solar System was really
dominated by these hot planets.

And that's just because of the
fact they're easier to find.

When the very first methods came online,

these were primarily the
Doppler spectroscopy method,

looking for wobbling stars,
and also the transit method.

And these two both have
a really strong bias

towards finding these hot planets.

Now, hot planets are interesting,

the chemistry in their
atmosphere is fascinating,

it's very alien.

An example of one that's
particularly close to my heart

is TrES-2b, whose atmosphere is so dark

it's less reflective than coal.

And so they have really
bizarre photometric properties,

yet at the same time they
resemble nothing like

our own home.

And so, it's said there's
two types of astrophysicists,

the astrophysicists who care
about how the universe works,

they wanna understand the
mechanics of the machinery

of this universe, why
did the big bang happen?

Why is the universe expanding
how are galaxies formed.

And there's another type of astrophysicist

which perhaps speaks to
me a little bit more,

it whispers into your ear,
and that is, why are we here?

Are we alone? Are there others out there?

And ultimately along this journey,

the hot planets aren't gonna get us there.

When we are looking for
life in the universe,

seems to make perfect
sense that there should be

planets like our own out there,

maybe even moons like our
own planet around gas giants

that could be habitable.

And so my research has been
driven by trying to find

these more miraculous
globes that might resemble

our own planet.

- So they're the ones that
lurk more in the shadows

in terms of how difficult it is to detect?

- They're much harder, they're
harder for several reasons.

The method we primarily
use is the transit method.

So this is really eclipses.

As the planet passes in front of the star,

it blocks out some starlight.

The problem with that is
that not all planets pass

in front of their star.

They have to be aligned correctly
from your line of sight.

And so the further away the
planet is from the star,

the cooler it is,

the less likely it is
that you're gonna get

that geometric alignment.

So whereas a hot Jupiter,
about 1% of hot Jupiters

will transit in front of
their star, only about 0.5%,

maybe even a quarter of a
percent of Earth-like planets

will have the right geometry to transit.

And so that makes it
much, much harder for us.

- What's the connection between
temperature of the planet,

geometrical alignment, probability

to geometrical alignment?

- There's not a direct connection

but they're connected via
an intermediate parameter,

which is their separation from the star.

So, the planet will be
cool if it's further

away from the star,

which in turn means that
the probability of getting

that alignment correct
is going to be less.

On top of that,

they also transit their
star less frequently.

So if you go to the telescope
and you want to discover

a hot Jupiter, you could
probably do it in a week or so,

because the orbital periods
of order of 1, 2, 3 days.

So you can actually get the full orbit two

or three times over.

Whereas if you wanted to
detect an Earth like planet,

you have to observe that
star for three, four years.

And that's actually one of
the problems with Kepler.

Kepler was this very
successful mission that NASA

launched over a decade ago now, I think.

And it discovered thousands of planets.

It's still the dominant
source of exoplanets

that we know about,

but unfortunately it didn't last as long

as we would've liked it to.

It died after about 4.35
years I think it was.

And so for an Earth-like
planet that's just enough

to catch four transits
and four transits was kind

of seen as the minimum.

But of course the more transits you see,

the easier it is to detect
it 'cause you build up

signal to noise.

If you see the same thing,
tick, tick, tick, tick,

the more ticks you get, the
easier it is to find it.

And so it was really a
shame that Kepler was

just at the limit of
where we were expecting

it to start to see Earth-like planets.

And in fact, it really found zero,

zero planets that are
around stars like the Sun,

are orbits similar to
the Earth around the Sun,

and could potentially

be similar to our own planet
in terms of its composition.

And so it's a great shame,

but that's why it gives
astronomers more to do

in the future.

- Just to clarify,

the transit method is our primary way

of detecting these things.

And what it is is when the object passes,

occludes the source of
light, just a tiny bit,

a few pixels, and from
that we can infer something

about its mass and size
and distance and geometry,

all of that?

That's like trying to tell, what,

at a party you can't see
anything about a person,

but you can just see by the
way they occlude others.

So this is the method. Yeah,
but is, this is super far away.

How many pixels of information do we have?

Basically how high
resolution is the signal

that we can get about these occlusions?

- You're right in your description.

I think just to build upon
that a little bit more,

it might be almost like your
vision is completely blurry.

Like you have an extreme,
you know, eye prescription,

and so you can't resolve anything.

Everything just blurs.

But you can tell that something
was there 'cause it just got

fainter for a short amount of time.

Someone passed in front of a light.

And so that light in
your eyes would just dim

for a short moment.

Now the reason we have that
problem with blurriness

or resolution is just because
the stars are so far away.

I mean these are,

the closest stars are
four light years away,

but most of the stars Kepler
looked at were thousands

of light years away.

And so there's absolutely no chance

that the telescope can
physically resolve the star

or even the separation between
the planet and the star is,

or is too small, especially
for a telescope like Kepler.

It's only a meter across.

In principle, you can
make those detections,

but you need a different
kind of telescope.

We call that direct imaging.

And direct imaging is a very exciting,

distinct way of detecting planets.

But it, as you can imagine,

is going to be far
easier to detect planets

which are really far away
from their star to do

that because that's gonna make
that separation really big,

and then you also want the
star to be really close to us,

so the nearest stars, not only that,

but you would prefer that
planet to be really hot,

because the hotter it
is, the brighter it is.

And so that tends to bias direct imaging

towards planets which are
in the process of forming.

So things which have just formed,

the planet has still got
all of its primordial heat

embedded within it.

And it's glowing. We can
see those quite easily.

But for the planets more
like the Earth, of course

they've cooled down.

And so we can't see that,

the light is pitiful compared
to a newly formed planet.

We would like to get
there with direct imaging.

That's the dream is to
have the pale blue dot,

natural photograph of it.

Maybe even just to one
pixel photograph of it.

But for now the entire
solar system is one pixel

certainly with the transit method

and most other telescopes.

And so all you can do is
see where that one pixel

which contains potentially
dozens of planets and the star,

maybe even multiple stars, dims
for a short amount of time.

- Dims just a little bit.

And from that you can infer something.

- Yeah, I mean it's like being a detective

on the scene, right?

It's indirect clues of the
existence of the planet.

- It's amazing that humans can do that.

We're just looking out in
these immense distances

and looking, you know,

if there's alien civilizations out there,

like let's say one exactly
like our own, we're like,

would we even be able to see an Earth

that passes in the way of
its sun and slightly dims?

And that's the only sign we have

of that alien human-like
civilization out there is,

it's just a little bit of a dimming.

- Yeah, I mean it depends
on the type of star

we're talking about.

If it is a star truly like
the Sun, the dip that causes

is 84 parts per million.

I mean that's just,
it's like the same as a,

as like a firefly flying in front of like

a giant floodlight at
a stadium or something.

That's the kind of the brightness contrast

that you're trying to compare to.

So it's extremely difficult
detection and in the very,

very best cases we can get down to that.

But as I said,

we don't really have any
true Earth analogs that have

been in the exoplanet candidate yet.

Unless you relax that definition,
you say it's not just,

doesn't have to be a star,

just like the Sun, it could
be a star that's smaller

than the Sun, it could
be these orange dwarfs

or even the red dwarf stars.

And the fact those stars are smaller means

that for the same size planet
passing in front of it,

more light is blocked out.

And so a very exciting system for example

is TRAPPIST-1 which has
seven planets which are

smaller than the Earth and those are quite

easily detectable, not with
a space-based telescope,

even from the ground.

And that's just 'cause the
star is so much smaller

that the relative increase
in or decrease in brightness

is enhanced significantly
'cause that smaller size.

So TRAPPIST-1e, it's a planet

which is in the right
distance for liquid water.

It has a slightly smaller
size on the Earth.

It's about 90% the size of
the Earth, about 80% the mass.

And it's one of the top targets right now

for potentially having life.

And yet it raises many
questions about what would

that environment be like.

This is a star which is one
eighth the mass of the Sun.

Stars like that take a long time

to come off that adolescence.

When stars first form like
the Sun, it takes them

maybe 10, 100 million
years to sort of settle in

to that main sequence lifetime.

But for stars like these
late M-dwarfs we call them,

they can take up to a billion
years or more to calm down.

And during that period
they're producing huge amounts

of X-rays, ultraviolet
radiation that could

potentially rip off the entire atmosphere.

It may desiccate the
planets in the system.

And so even if water arrived
by comets or something,

it may have lost all that water due

to this prolonged period of high activity.

So we have lots of open-ended questions

about these M-dwarf planets,

but they are the most accessible.

And so in the near term,

if we detect anything in
terms of biosignatures,

it's gonna be for one of
these red dwarf stars.

It's not gonna be a true
Earth twin as we would

recognize it as having a yellow star.

- Well, let me ask you,

I mean there's a million
ways to ask this question.

I'm sure I'll ask it
about habitable worlds.

Let's just go to our own Solar System.

What can we learn about
the planets and moons

in our Solar System
that might contain life,

whether it's Mars or some of them moons

of Jupiter and Saturn?

What kind of characteristics,

'cause you said it might not need to be

Earth-like, what kind of
characteristics might be,

we'd be looking for.

- When we look for life,

it's hard to define even what life is,

but we can maybe do a better
job in defining the sorts

of things that life does and
that provides some aspects

to some avenue for looking for them.

Any classically, conventionally,
I think we thought

the way to look for life
was to look for oxygen.

Oxygen is a byproduct of
photosynthesis on this planet.

We didn't always have it.

Certainly if you go back to
the Archean period, there was,

you know, you have this period called

the Great Oxidation Event
where the Earth floods

with oxygen for the first
time and starts to saturate

the oceans and then the atmosphere.

And so that oxygen, if we
detect it on another planet,

whether it be Mars, Venus or
an exoplanet, whatever it is,

that was long thought to be evidence

for something doing photosynthesis.

Because if you took
away all the plant life

on the Earth, the oxygen
wouldn't just hang around here,

it's a highly reactive molecule,
it would oxidize things.

And so within about million
years you would probably

lose all the oxygen on planet Earth.

So that was a conventionally
how we thought we could

look for life.

And then we started to
realize that it's not

so simple because, A,
there might be other things

that life does apart from photosynthesis.

Certainly the vast majority
of the Earth's history had

no oxygen and yet there
was living things on it.

So that doesn't seem like a complete test.

And secondly, could there be other things

that produce oxygen besides from life?

A growing concern has
been these false positives

in biosignature work.

And so one example of
that would be photolysis,

that happens in the atmosphere
when ultraviolet light

hits the upper atmosphere,
can break up water vapor,

the hydrogen splits off to the oxygen,

the hydrogen is a much
lighter atomic species,

and so it can actually
escape certain planets like

the Earth's gravity.

That's why we don't have any hydrogen

or very little helium.

And so that leaves you with the oxygen,

which then oxidizes the surface.

And so there could be a
residual oxygen signature

just due to this catalysis process.

So we've been trying to
generalize and certainly

in recent years there's
been other suggestions,

things we could look for in
the Solar System and beyond,

nitrous oxide,

basically laughing gas
is a product of microbes.

That's something that
we are starting to get

more interested in looking for.

Methane gas in combination
with other gases can be

an important biosignature.

Phosphine as well.

And phosphine is particularly relevant

to the Solar System
because there was a lot

of interest for Venus recently.

You may have heard that there was a claim

of a biosignature in Venus's atmosphere,

I think it was like two years ago now.

And the judge and jury
is still out on that.

There was a very provocative
claim and signature

of a phosphine like spectral absorption.

But it could have also have
been some of the molecule,

in particular sulfur dioxide,
which is not a biosignature.

- So this is a detection
of a gas in the atmosphere

of Venus and it might be controversial

in several dimensions.

So one, how to interpret
that, two is there a gas,

and three, is this even
the right detection?

Is there an error in the detection?

- Yeah, I mean how much do
we believe the detection

in the first place, if you do believe it,

does that necessarily mean there's life

there and what gives,

how can you have life
in the Venus' atmosphere

in the first place?

Because that's, you know,

Venus is seen as like a hellhole
place for imagining life.

But I guess the counter that
has been that, okay, yes,

the surface is a horrendous
place to imagine life thriving,

but as you go up in altitude,

a very dense atmosphere means

that there is a cloud
layer where the temperature

and the pressure become
actually fairly similar

to the surface of the Earth.

And so it may be there are
microbes stirring around

in the clouds, which
are producing phosphine.

At the moment this is fascinating.

It's got a lot of us
reinvigorated about the prospects

of going back to Venus and
doing the mission there.

In fact, there's now two NASA missions,

VERITAS and DAVINCI, which
are gonna be going back

before 2030 or the 2030s.

And then we have a
European mission I think

that's slated now.

And even a Chinese mission might be coming

along the way as well.

So it might have multiple missions going

to Venus, which has long been overlooked.

I mean apart from the
Soviets, there really has been

very little in the way
of exploration of Venus.

That's certainly as compared to Mars.

Mars has enjoyed most of
the activity from NASA's

rovers and surveys.

And Mars is certainly fascinating.

There's, you know, this
signature of methane that has

been seen there before.

Again, there the discussion
is whether that methane

is a product of biology,
which is possible,

certainly that happens

on the Earth, or whether
it's some geological process

that we are yet to fully
understand could be a, you know,

for example a reservoir
of methane that's trapped

under the surface and it's
leaking out seasonally.

- So the nice thing

about Venus is if there's a giant living

civilization there, it'll be airborne.

So you can just fly through
and collect samples.

With Mars and moons of Saturn, Jupiter,

you're gonna have to dig

under to find the
civilizations, dead or a living.

- Right.

And so yeah, maybe it's easier then

for Venus because
certainly you can imagine

just a balloon floating
through the atmosphere that,

or a drone or something that
would have the capability

of just scooping up and sampling.

To dig into the surface of Mars
is maybe feasible-ish with,

you know, especially with
something like Starship

that could launch, you know,

a huge digger basically to
the surface and you could

just excavate away at the surface.

But for something like
Europa, we really are still

unclear about how thick the ice layer is,

how you would melt through
that huge thick layer to get

to the ocean.

And then potentially also
discussions about contamination.

The problem with looking for life

in the Solar System, which
is different from looking

for life with exoplanets,

is that you always run the risk of,

especially if you visit there,

of introducing the life yourself, right?

It's very difficult to
completely exterminate

every single microbe
and spore on the surface

of your rover or the
surface of your lander.

And so there's always a risk
of introducing something.

I mean, to some extent
there is continuous exchange

of material between these
planets naturally on top

of that as well.

And now we're sort of
accelerating that process

to some degree.

And so if you dig into Europa's surface,

which probably is completely pristine,

it's very unlikely there
has been much exchange

with the outside world
for its subsurface ocean,

you are for the first time potentially

introducing bacterial
spores into that environment

that may compete or may
introduce spurious signatures

for the life you're looking for.

And so it's almost an ethical question

as to how to proceed with looking for life

on those subsurface oceans.

And I don't think one
we've really have a good

resolution for this point.

- Ethical?

So you mean ethical in
terms of concern for the,

like for preserving life elsewhere,

not like not to murder it?

As opposed to scientific one?

- I mean we always worry
about a space virus, right,

coming here or you know,

some kind of external source
and we would be the source

of that potential contamination...

- Or the other direction.
- Yeah.

- I mean they, that, you know,

the whatever survives in
such harsh conditions,

might be pretty good at
surviving all conditions.

It might be a little bit
more resilient and robust.

So I might actually take
a ride on us back home.

- Possibly.

I mean, I'm sure that some people

would be concerned about that.

I think we would hopefully have some

containment procedures as
if we did sample return,

or you mean you don't even
really need a sample return.

These days you mean you can
pretty much send it like

a little micro-laboratory
to the planet to do all

the experiments in situ and
then just send them back

to your planet, the data.

And so I don't think
there's is necessary that,

especially for a case like that,

where you might have
contamination concerns

that you have to bring samples back.

Although probably if you
brought Europan sushi,

it would probably sell for quite

a bit with the billionaires
in New York City.

- Sushi. Yeah.

I would love from an
engineering perspective,

just to see all the different
candidates and designs

for like the scooper for
Venus and the scooper

for Europa and Mars,
haven't really looked deeply

into how they actually,

like the actual engineering
of collecting the samples,

because that's, the engineering

of that is probably essential for not

either destroying life
or polluting with our own

microbes and so on.

So that's a good interesting
engineering challenge.

I usually, for rovers and
stuff, focus on the robot,

on the sort of the mobility
aspect of it, on the robotics,

the perception and the
movement and the planning

and the control.

But there's probably
the scooper is probably

where the action is, the
microscopic sample collection.

So basically you have to
first clean your vehicle,

make sure it doesn't have
any Earth-like things on it,

and then you have to put
it into some kind of thing

that's perfectly sealed
from the environment,

so if we bring it back or we analyze it,

it's not going to bring
anything else external in.

Yeah, I don't know,

that would be an interesting
engineering design there.

- Yeah, I mean Curiosity has been leaving

these little pots on the
surface quite recently.

There's some neat photos
that you can find online.

And they kind of look like
lightsaber hilts, which,

so they, yeah, to me I think
I tweeted something like,

you know, this weapon is your life.

Like don't lose it, Curiosity.

Because it's just dumping
these little vials everywhere,

and it's, yeah, it is
scooping up these things

and the intention is that
in the future there will be

a sample return mission that
will come and pick these up.

But it's, I mean the
engineering behind those things

is so impressive.

The thing that blows me
away the most has been

the landings, especially
I'm trained to be a pilot

at the moment, so that's
the sort of, you know,

watching landings has
become like my pet hobby

on YouTube at the moment
and how not to do it,

how to do it with different levels

of conditions and things.

But with the, you know,

when you think about landing

on Mars, just the light
travel time effect means

that there's no possibility of a human

controlling that dissent.

And so you have to put all
of your faith and your trust

in the computer code or the AI or whatever

it is that you've put on
board that thing to make

the correct dissent.

And so there's this famous period

called seven minutes of hell
where you're basically waiting

for that light travel
time to come back to know

whether your vehicle successfully landed

on the surface or not.

And during that period,

you know in your mind simultaneously

that it is doing these
multi-stages of deploying

its parachute, deploying the crane,

activating its jets to
come down and controlling

its dissent to the surface
and then the crane has

to fly away so it doesn't
accidentally hit the rover.

And so there's a series of
multi-stage points where any

of them go wrong, you know,

the whole mission could go awry.

And so the fact that we
are fairly consistently

able to build these machines
that can do this autonomously

is to me one of the most impressive acts

of engineering that NASA have achieved.

- Yes, the unfortunate fact about physics

is the takeoff is easier than the landing.

- Yes, yes. (laughs)
- And you mentioned Starship,

one of the incredible
engineering feats you get to see

is the reusable rockets that
take off, but they land,

and they land using control
and they do so perfectly.

And sometimes when it's
synchronous it's just,

it's beautiful to see.

And then with Starship
you see the chopsticks

that catch the ship.

I mean there's just so much
incredible engineering,

but you mentioned starships
is somehow helpful here.

So what's your hope with Starship?

What kind of science
might it enable, possibly?

- There's two things.

I mean it's the launch cost itself,

which is hopefully
gonna mean per kilograms

gonna dramatically reduce the cost of,

its the sort of the level,

even if it's a factor of 10 higher

than what Elon originally promised,

this is gonna be a revolution
for the cost to launch.

That means you could
do all sorts of things.

You could launch large telescopes,

which could be basically
like JWST but you don't

even have to fold them up.

JWST had this whole issue with its design

that it's six and a half meters
across and so you have to,

there's no fuselage which
is that large at the time.

Ares IV wasn't large enough for that.

And so they had to fold it up in this kind

of complicated origami.

And so a large part of
the cost was figuring

out how to fold it up, testing
that it unfolded correctly,

repeated testing and you know,

there was something like 130 fail points

or something during this
unfolding mechanism.

And so all of us were holding our breath

during that process.

But if you have the ability
to just launch, you know,

arbitrarily large masses,
at least comparatively

compared to JWST and very
large mirrors into space,

you can more or less repurpose
ground-based mirrors.

The Hubble Space Telescope
mirror and the JWST mirrors

are designed to be extremely lightweight

and that increased their
cost significantly.

They have these kind of
honeycomb design on the back

to try and minimize the weight.

If you don't really care about weight

because it's so cheap,

then you could just literally grab many

of the existing
ground-based mirrors across

telescopes across the world, four meter,

five meter mirrors and
just pretty much attach 'em

to a chassis and have your
own space-based telescope.

I think the Breakthrough
Foundation, for instance,

is an entity that has
been interested in doing

this sort of thing.

And so that raises the
prospects of having not

just one JWST that just, you know,

JWST is a fantastic resource,

but it's split between
all of us: cosmologists

staff formation astronomers, those of us

studying exoplanets, those
of us wanting to study,

you know, the ultra deep
fields and the origin

of the first galaxies, the
expansion of the universe.

Everyone has to share this resource.

But we could potentially
each have, you know,

one JWST each that is maybe
just studying a handful

of the brightest exoplanet stars

and measuring their atmospheres.

This is important because if, you know,

we talked about this
planet TRAPPIST-1e earlier,

that planet, if JWST
studied it and tried to look

for biosignatures, by which
I mean oxygen, nitrous oxide,

methane, it would take it
of order of 200 transits

to get even a very marginal,

what we call two and a
half Sigma detection,

of those, which basically
nobody would believe, with that.

And 100 transits, I
mean this thing transits

once every six days,

so you're talking about sort
of four years of staring

at the same star with one telescope.

There'd be some breaks,

but it'd be hard to schedule
much else because you'll

have to continuously catch
each one of these transits

to build up your signal to noise.

And so JWST is never gonna do that.

In principle, technically,
JWST could, technically,

have the capability of
just about detecting

a biosignature on an
Earth-like planet around

a non-sunlike star.

But still impressively we have basically

the technologies to do that,

but we simply cannot
dedicate all of its time

practically to that one resource.

And so Starship opens up
opportunities like that,

of mass producing these
kinds of telescopes

which will allow us to survey
for life in the universe,

which of course is one of
the grand goals of astronomy.

- I wonder if you can
speak to the bureaucracy,

the political battles, the
scientific battles for time

on the James Webb Telescope.

There must be a fascinating process

of scheduling that, all
scientists that are trying

to collaborate and
figure out what the most

important problems are
and there's an interesting

network of interfering
scientific experiments

probably have to somehow optimize over.

- It's a really difficult process.

I don't envy the TAC that are gonna have

to make this decision.

We call the TAC, the time
allocation committee,

that makes this decision, and I've served

on these before and it's very difficult.

I mean typically for Hubble
we were seeing at least 10,

sometimes 20 times the number of proposals

for telescope time versus
available telescope time.

For JWST there has been one
call already that has gone out,

we call it cycle one,

and that was oversubscribed
by I think something like

six to one, seven to one.

And the cycle two,

which has just been
announced fairly recently

and the deadline is
actually end of this month,

so my team are totally
laser focused on writing

our proposals right now,

that is expected to be
much more competitive,

probably more comparable
to what Hubble saw.

And so it's hard.

- More competitive than the
second one, you said, already?

'Cause that's already-
- More competitive

than the first cycle.

So I said the first cycle
of James Webb was about six

to one and this will probably
be more like 20 to one,

I would expect.

- So these are all proposals
by scientists and so on?

And it's not like you
can schedule at any time.

'Cause if you're looking
for transit times...

- Yeah, you have a time critical element.

- Yes. Time critical element.

And they're conflicting in non-like,

non-obvious ways 'cause
the frequency is different,

the duration is different,

there's probably computational
needs that are different,

there's the type of sensors,
the direction pointing,

all of that.

- Yeah, it, it's hard.

And there are certain
programs like doing a deep

field study where you
just more or less point

the telescope and that's pretty open.

I mean you're just accumulating photons.

You can just point at
that patch of the sky

whenever the telescope is
not doing anything else

and just get to your month,

let's say a month of
integration time is your goal

over the lifetime at JWST.

So that's maybe a little
bit easier to schedule.

It's harder, especially for
us looking at cool worlds,

because as I said earlier,

these planets transit vary infrequently.

So we have to wait,

if you're looking at the Earth transiting

the Sun, an alien watching us,

they would only get one
opportunity per year

to do that observation.

The transit lasts for about 12 hours.

And so if they don't get that
time, it's hard. That's it.

If it conflicted with another
proposal that wants to do,

use the, another time critical element.

It's much easier for planets
like these hot planets

or these close-in planets
because they transit

so frequently there's
may be 100 opportunities.

And so then the TAC can say
okay, they want 10 transits,

there's 100 opportunities here.

It's easier for us to
give us to give them time.

We are almost in the worst case scenario,

we are proposing to look for exomoons

around two cool planets.

And so we really only have
one bite of the cherry

for each one.

And so our sales pitch
has been that these are

extremely precious events,
and more importantly,

JWST is the only telescope,

the only machine humanity
has ever constructed,

which is capable of finding
moons akin to the moons

in our Solar System.

Kepler can't do it.
Even Hubble can't do it.

JWST is the first one.

And so there is a new
window to the universe,

'cause we know these moons exist.

They're all over the place

in the Solar System, you
have the Moon, you have

Io, Calisto, Europa,
Ganimede, Titan, lots of moons

are fairly similar size, sort
of 30% the size of the Earth.

And this telescope is the
first one that can find them.

And so we are very
excited about the profound

implications of ultimately
solving this journey

we're on in astronomy,

which is to understand our uniqueness.

We wanna understand how
common is the Solar System.

Are we the architecture
that frequently emerges

naturally or is there something special

about what happened here?

- I think this is not the
worst case, it's the best case.

It's obvious, it's super rare.

So you have to like, I would,

I love scheduling from a
computer science perspective.

That's my background.

So algorithmically, to
solve schedule problem,

I would schedule the rarest things first.

And obviously this is the
JWST is the first thing

that can actually detect a cool world.

So this is a big new thing,

you can show off that new
thing, happens rarely,

schedule it first, it's perfect.

- [David] You should be
on a TAC. This is perfect.

- I will.

I'll file my application
after we're done with this.

I, you know, this part of
me is the OCD part of me

is the computational aspect,

I love scheduling, computing device,

'cause you have that kind of
scheduling on supercomputers,

on, that scheduling
problem is fascinating.

How do you prioritize computation?

How do you prioritize
science, data collection,

sample collection, all that kind of stuff.

It's actually kind of
fascinating because data in ways

you expect and don't
expect will unlock a lot

of solutions to some
fascinating mysteries.

And so collecting the
data and doing so in a way

that maximizes the
possibility of discovery

is really interesting.

Like from a computational perspective.

- I agree.

There's a real satisfaction
extracting the maximum

science per unit time...

- Yeah, exactly.
- Out of your telescope.

And that that's the TAC's job.

But the TAC are not machines,

they're not a piece of computer code.

They will make their selections
based off human judgment.

And a lot of the telescope is

certainly within the field of exoplanets

'cause there's different
fields of astronomy,

but within the field of exoplanets,

I think a good expectation is that most

of the telescope time
that JWST have will go

towards atmospheric retrieval,
which is sort of alluded

to earlier, you know,

like detecting molecules

in the atmospheres, not biosignatures.

'Cause as I said, it's really
not designed to do that.

It's pushing JWST probably
too far to expect to do that.

But it could detect, for example,

a carbon dioxide rich atmosphere

on TRAPPIST-1e, that's not a biosignature,

but you could prove it's
like a Venus in that case

or maybe like a Mars in that case.

Like both those have carbon
dioxide rich atmospheres.

Doesn't prove or disprove the
existence of life either way.

But it is our first
characterization of the nature

of those atmospheres.

Maybe we can even tell the pressure level

and the temperature of those atmospheres.

So that's very exciting.

But there's, we are competing

with that and that I think
that science is completely

mind blowing and fantastic,

we have a completely
different objective, which is,

in our case, to try and
look for the first evidence

of these small moons around these planets,

potentially even moons which
could be habitable of course.

So I think it's a very exciting goal.

But a TAC has to make a
human judgment essentially

about which science are
they most excited by,

which one has the highest
promise of return,

the most highest chance of return.

And so that's hard because if you look

at a planetary atmosphere, well, you know

most of the time the planet
has an atmosphere already,

and so there's almost a guaranteed success

that you're gonna learn
something about the atmosphere

by pointing JWST at it.

Whereas in our case,
there's a harder sell.

We are looking for something
that we do not know

for sure exists yet or not.

And so we are pushing the
telescope to do something

which is inherently more risky.

- Yeah.

But the existence, if shown,

already gives a deep lesson

about what's out there in the universe.

But that means that other
stars have similar types

of variety as we have in our Solar System.

They have an Io, they
have a Europa and so on,

which means like there's
a lot of possibility

for icy planets, for water,
for planets that enable,

planets and moons...

I mean that, that's super
exciting because that means

everywhere through our galaxy and beyond,

there is just innumerable
possibility for weird creatures.

- I agree.
- Lifeforms.

- You don't have to
convince me, I absolutely...

I mean NASA has been on
this quest for a long time

and it's sometimes called eta-Earth.

It's the frequency of Earth-like,
usually they say planets,

in the universe.

How common are planets
similar to our, in terms of,

ultimately we'd like to know everything

about these planets in
terms of the amount of water

they have, how much
atmosphere they have...

But for now it's kind of
focused just on the size

and the distance from
the star essentially.

How often do you get
similar conditions to that?

That was Kepler's primary
mission and it really

just kind of flirted with the answer.

Didn't quite get to a definitive answer.

But I always say, look, if we are looking,

if that's our primary goal,

to look for Earth-like,
I would say worlds,

then moons has to be a part of that,

because we know

that Earth-like, and so
from the Kepler data,

the preliminary results,
that Earth-like planets

around Sun-like stars is
not an inevitable outcome.

It seems to be something
like a 1% to 10% outcome.

So it's not particularly
inevitable that happens.

But we do often see about
half of all Sun-like stars

have either a mini-Neptune,

a Neptune, or a Jupiter in
habitable zone of their stars.

That's a very, very common
occurrence that we see,

yet we have no idea how often
they have moons around them,

which could also be habitable.

And so there may very well be,

if even one in five of
them has an Earth-like moon

or even a Mars-like moon around them,

then there would be more
habitable real estate in terms

of exomoons than
exoplanets in the universe.

- So you can essentially
2x, 3x, 5x, maybe 10x

the number of habitable worlds
out there in the universe,

our current estimate for
like the Drake equation.

- [David] Absolutely. Yeah.

- So this is one way to
increase the confidence

and increase the value of that parameter.

- And just know where to look.

I mean we would like to
know where should we listen

for techno-signatures?

Where should we be
looking for biosignatures?

And not only that,

but what role does the moon have in terms

of its influence on the planet?

We talked about these directly
image telescopes earlier.

These missions that want to take a photo,

to quote Carl Sagan, the
pale blue dot of our planet,

but the pale blue dot of an exoplanet.

And that's the dream to
one day capture that.

But as impressive as the resolution

is that we are planning
and conspiring to design

for the future generation
telescopes to achieve that,

even those telescopes will
not have the capability

of resolving the Earth
and the Moon within that.

It'll be a pale blue dot
pixel, but the moon's grayness

will be intermixed with that pixel.

And so this is a big problem
because one of the ways

that we are claiming to look
for life in the universe

is a chemical disequilibrium.

So you see two molecules
that just shouldn't be there,

they normally react with
each other or even one

molecule that's just too
reactive to be hanging around

the atmosphere by itself.

So if you had oxygen and
methane hanging out together,

those would normally react fairly easily.

And so if you detected those two molecules

in your pale blue dot
spectra, you be okay,

we have evidence for life,

some thing's metabolizing on this planet.

However, the challenge is
what if that moon was Titan,

Titan has a methane rich atmosphere,

and what if the pale blue
dot was in fact a planet

devoid of life, but it had oxygen

because of water undergoing
this photolysis reaction,

splitting into oxygen
and hydrogen separately.

So then you have all of the hallmarks

of what we would claim to be life,

but all along you were tricked.

It was just a moon that was deceiving you.

And so we are never gonna,

I would claim, really understand

or complete this quest of
looking for life biosignatures

in the universe unless
we have a deep knowledge

of the prevalence and
role that moons have,

they may even affect the habitability

of the planets themselves.

Of course our own Moon
is freakishly large.

By mass ratio it's the largest
moon in the Solar System.

It's a 1% mass moon.

If you look at Jupiter's moons,
are like 10th to the power

minus four, much smaller.

And so our own Moon seems to stabilize

the liquidity of our planet.

It gives rise to tides.

Especially early on,
when the Moon was closer,

those tides would've
covered entire continents.

And those rock pools that
would've been scattered

across the entire plateau
may have been the origin

of life on our planet,
the moon forming impact

may have stripped a significant
fraction of lithosphere

of the Earth, which without
it, plate tectonics may not

have been possible, we had a stagnant lid

'cause it was just too much
lithosphere stuck on the top

of the planet.

And so there are speculative reasons,

but intriguing reasons as
to why a large moon may be

not just important, but
central to the question

of having the conditions
necessary for life.

So moons can be habitable
in their own right,

but they can also play
significant influence

on the habitability of
the planets they orbit.

And further, they will surely interfere

with our attempts to detect
life remotely from afar.

- So taking a tangent upon a tangent,

you've written about binary planet,

and that they're surprisingly common

or they might be surprisingly common.

What's the difference

between a large moon and binary planet?

What are binary planets?

What's interesting to say here about giant

rocks flying through space
and orbiting each other?

- The thing that's interesting
about binary objects

is that they're very
common in the universe.

Binary stars are everywhere.

In fact, the majority
of stars seem to live

in binary systems.

When we look at the outer edges

of the Solar System, we see
binary Kuiper belt objects

all the time.

Asteroids basically bound to one another.

Pluto and Charon is kind
of an example of that.

It's a 10% mass ratio system.

It almost is, by many
definitions, a binary planet,

but now it's a dwarf planet.

So, I dunno what you call that
now, but we know that these,

you know, the universe likes
to make things in pairs.

- Yeah. So you're saying
our Sun is an incel?

It's looking, so most things are dating,

they're in relationships
and ours is alone.

- It's not a complete
freak of the universe

to be alone, but it's more common

for something like stars.

If you count up all the
Sun-like stars in the universe,

about half of the Sun-like
star systems are in binary

or trinary systems and
the other half are single.

But because those binaries
are two or three stars,

then cumulatively,

maybe like a third of all
Sun-like stars are single.

- I'm trying hard to not
anthropomorphize the relationship.

The stars are with each other.

- [David] But yeah, triplet,
the triplets are the truth.

- Yeah, that's, yeah,
I've met those folks also.

So is there something interesting to learn

about the habitability,

how that affects the
probability of habitable worlds

when they kind of couple up like that

in those different ways?

- Well, it depends on
what we're talking about,

the stars or the planets.

Certainly if stars couple up,

that has a big influence
on the habitability.

Of course, this is very
famous from "Star Wars,"

Tatooine in "Star Wars"
is a binary star system.

And you have Luke Skywalker
looking at the sunset

and seeing two stars come down.

And for years we thought
that was purely a product

of George Lucas's
incredibly creative mind.

And we didn't think that
planets would exist around

binary star systems.

It seems like too
tumultuous an environment

for a quiescent planety disk,

circumstellar disk to form planets from.

And yet, one of the astounding
discoveries from Kepler

was that these appear to be quite common.

In fact, as far as we can tell,

they're just as common around
binary stars as single stars.

The only caveat to that
is that you don't get

planets close-in to binary stars.

They have like a clearance
region on the inside,

where planets, maybe they form
there, but they don't last.

They're dynamically unstable in that zone.

But once you get out to about the distance

of the Earth orbits the Sun or
even a little bit closer in,

you start to find planets emerging.

And so that's the right
distance for liquid water,

it's the right distance
for potentially life

on those planets, and so
there may very well be plenty

of habitat planets
around the binary stars.

Binary planets is a little bit
different. Binary planets...

I don't think we have
any serious connection

of planet binarity to habitability.

Certainly when we investigated it,

that wasn't our drive that
this is somehow the solution

to life in the universe or anything.

It was really just a like
awkward science question,

a curiosity driven question.

- Was the dynamic, are they
legit or orbiting each other,

as they orbit the star?

- So the formation
mechanism proposed here,

'cause it is very difficult
to form two protoplanets

close to each other like this.

They were generally
merged within the disc.

And so that's why you
normally get single planets.

But you could have something
like Jupiter and Saturn

form at separate distances.

They could dynamically be
scattered in towards one

another and basically not quite collide,

but have a very close on encounter.

Now, because tidal forces
increase dramatically

as the distance decreases
between two objects,

the tides can actually
dissipate the kinetic energy

and bring them bound into one another.

So that seemed, when we, you know,

when you first hear that you think, well,

that seems fairly
contrived that you'd have

the conditions just
right to get these tides

to cause a capture.

But numerical simulations
have shown that about 10%

of planet-to-planet encounters

are shown to produce something

like binary planets, which
is a startling prediction.

And so that seems at odds with naively

the exoplanet catalog for
which we know of so far are

no binary planets.

And we propose one of the
resolutions to this might

be that the binary planets
are just incredibly

difficult to detect, which
is also counterintuitive,

because remember how they form

is through this tidal mechanism,

and so they form extremely
close to each other.

Sort of the distance that
Io is away from Jupiter,

just a few planetary radii,

they're almost touching one another

and they're just tidally
locked facing each other

for eternity, and so
in that configuration,

as it transits across the star,

it kind of looks like
you can't really resolve

those two planets.

It just looks like one
planet to you that's going

across the star.

The temporal resolution
of the data is rarely good

enough to distinguish that.

And so you'd see one transit,

but in fact it's two
planets very close together,

which are transiting at once.

And so yeah, we wrote
a paper just recently

where we developed some
techniques to try and get

around this problem and
hopefully provide a tool

where we could finally
look for these planets.

- [Lex] The problem of
detection of these planets

when they're so close.

- That was our focus,

was how do you get round
this merging problem?

So whether they're out
there or not, we don't know,

we are planning to do a search for them,

but it remains an open question,

and I think just one of
those fun astrophysics

curiosities questions,
whether binary planets exist

in the universe.

'Cause then, you know,

you have binary Earths, you
could have binary Neptunes,

all sorts of wild stuff
that would, you know,

float to the sci-fi imagination.

- I wonder what the physics
on a binary planet feels like.

It might be trivial. I
have to think about that.

I wonder if there's some
interesting dynamics,

like you feel multiple,

or would gravity feel
different in different parts

of the surface of the
sphere when there's another

large sphere that's in-
- Yeah.

I would think that the force
would be fairly similar,

because the shape of
the object would deform

to a flat geopotential, essentially.

Uniform geopotential.

But it would lead to a distorted
shape for the two objects.

I think they'd become
ellipsoids facing one another.

So it would be pretty
wild when you, you know,

people like flat Earth or
historical Earth, you fly

from space, you see your
football shaped Earth.

That's your own planet.

- Finally. There's proof.

And I wonder how difficult
it would be to travel

from one to the other.

'Cause you have to overcome the, one...

No, it might be kind of easy.

- Yeah, I mean they're so close
to each other, that helps.

And I think the most
critical factor would be

how massive is the planet?

That's always, I mean,

one of the challenges
with escaping planets,

there was a fun paper one
of my colleagues wrote,

that suggested that super-Earth
planets may be inescapable.

If you were a civilization that
were born on a super-Earth,

the surface gravity is
so high that the chemical

potential energy of hydrogen or methane,

whatever fuel you're using,

simply is at odds with the
gravity of the planet itself.

And so you would, you
know, our current rockets,

I'm not sure whether the fraction,

but maybe like 90% of the rocket is fuel

or something by mass.

These things would have
to be like the size

of the Giza pyramids of
fuel with just a tiny tip

on the top in order just to escape

their planetary atmosphere.

And so it has been argued that if you live

on a super-Earth, you may be
forced to live there forever.

There may be no escape
unless you invent a space

elevator or something.

But then how do you even
build the infrastructure

in space to do something
like that in the absence

of a successful rocket program.

And so the more and more we look

at our Earth and think
about the sorts of problems

we are facing, the more you see things

about the Earth, which
make it ideally suited

in so many regards, it's
almost spooky, right,

that we not only live
on a planet which has

the right conditions for
life, for intelligent life,

for sustained fossil fuel industry,

just happens to be in the ground,

we have plenty of fossil fuels to get

our industrial revolution going.

But also the chemical energy contained

within those fossil fuels
and hydrogen and other fuels

is sufficient that we
have the ability to escape

our planetary atmosphere and
planetary gravity to have

a space program.

And we also happen to
have a celestial body,

which is just within reach,
the Moon, which doesn't

also necessarily have to be true.

Were the Moon not there,

what effect would that
have had on our aspirations

of a space program in the 1960s?

Would there have ever been a space race

to Mars or to Venus?

It's a much harder,

certainly for a human
program that seems almost

impossible with 1960s
technology to imagine have

it come to fruition.

- It's almost as if
somebody constructed a set

of challenging obstacles before us,

challenging problems to solve.

They're challenging, but they're doable,

and there's a sequence to them.

Gravity is very difficult
to overcome, but we have,

given the size of Earth,
it's not so bad that we can

still actually construct
propulsion systems

that can escape it.

- Yeah. And the same with
climate change perhaps.

I mean, climate change
is the next major problem

facing our civilization, but we know

it is technically surmountable.

You know, it does seem sometimes

like there has been a series

of challenges laid out to progress us

towards a mature
civilization that can one day

perhaps expand to the stars.

- I'm a little more concerned
about nuclear weapons,

AI and natural or artificial pandemics.

But yes, climate change.
- Yeah. Well, there you go.

I mean, plenty of milestones
that we need to cross

and we can argue about the
severity of each of them,

but there is no doubt
that we live in a world

that has serious
challenges that are pushing

our intellects and our will to the limit

of whether we are really ready to progress

to the next stage of our development.

- So thank you for taking the tangent.

And there'll be a million more.

But can we step back to
Kepler-1625b? What is it?

And you've talked about
this kind of journey,

this effort to discover exomoons,

so moons out there or small
cool objects out there.

Where does that effort stand
and what is Kepler-1625b?

- Yeah, I mean I've been
searching for exomoons

for most of my professional
career and I think a lot

of my colleagues think
I'm kind of crazy to still

be doing it.

You know, after five years
of not finding anything,

I think most people would probably try

doing something else.

I even had people say that to
me and they said, you know,

professors, and remember at a party,

a cocktail party, took me to the side,

an MIT professor and he said, you know,

you should just look for hot Jupiters.

They're everywhere.

It's really, you can write
papers, they're so easy to find.

And I was like, yeah,
but hot Jupiter's just,

they're not interesting to me.

I want to do something
that I feel intellectually

pushes me to the edge and
is maybe a contribution

that not no one else could do,

but maybe is not certainly the
thing that anybody could do.

I don't wanna just be
the first to something

for the sake of being first.

I wanna do something that feels like

a meaningful intellectual
contribution to our society.

And so, you know,

this exomoon problem has
been haunting me for years

to try and solve this.

Now, as I said,

we looked for years and years using Kepler

and the closest we ever
got was just a hint

for this one star,

Kepler-1625, has a Jupiter-like
planet in orbit of it.

And that Jupiter-like planet
is on a 287 day period.

So it's almost the same
distance as the Earth

around the Sun, but for a Jupiter.

So that was already unusual.

I don't think people realize
that Jupiter-like planets

are quite rare in the universe.

Certainly mini-Neptunes and
Neptunes are extremely common,

but Jupiters, only about
10% of Sun-like stars

have Jupiters around them
as far as we can tell.

- When you say Jupiter,
which aspect of Jupiter?

- In terms of its mass
and its semi-major axis.

So anything beyond about
half an AU, so half

the distance of the Earth
and the Sun and something

of order of a 10th of a Jupiter mass,

that's the mass of Saturn,
up to say 10 Jupiter masses,

which is basically where you
start to get to brown dwarfs.

Those types of objects appear
to be somewhat unusual.

Most solar systems do not have Jupiters,

which is really interesting

because Jupiter, again,
like the Moon, seems to have

been a pivotal character in the story

of the development of
our Solar System, perhaps

especially having a large
influence of the development

of the late heavy bombardment and the rate

of asteroid impacts that we
receive and things like this.

Anyway, to come back to 1625,
this Jupiter-like planet

had a hint of something in the data.

But what I mean by that is
when we looked at the transit,

we got the familiar decrease
in light that we always

see when a planet transit
in front of the star.

But we saw something extra.

Just on the edges we saw some extra dips

around the outside.

It was right at the hairy
edge of detectability.

We didn't believe it because,

I think one of the challenges
of looking for something

for 10 years is that you become
your own greatest skeptic.

And no matter what you are shown,

you are always thinking I've been,

it's like falling in love
so many times and it not

working out, you convince
yourself it's never gonna be,

it's never gonna happen.

Not for me.

You know, this just isn't gonna happen.

And so I saw that and I
didn't really believe it

'cause I didn't dare
let myself believe it.

But being a good scientist,

we knew we had an
obligation to publish it,

to talk about the result
and to follow it up

and to try and resolve what was going on.

So we asked for Hubble
Space Telescope time,

which was awarded in that case,

so we were one of those lucky
20 that got telescope time,

and we stared at it for
about 40 hours continuously.

And to provide some context,

the dip that we saw on the
Kepler data corresponded

to a Neptune-sized moon
around a Jupiter-sized planet,

which was another reason
why I was skeptical.

I was like, we don't have

that in the Solar System,
that seems so strange.

And then when we got the Hubble data,

it seemed to confirm exactly that,

there was two really
striking pieces of evidence

in the data that suggested
this moon was there.

Another was a fairly
clear second dip in light,

pretty clearly resolved by Hubble.

It was about a five sigma detection.

And on top of that we
could see the planet didn't

transit when it should have done,

it actually transited earlier
than we expected it to

by about 20 minutes or so.

And so that's a hallmark
of a gravitational

interaction between the
planet and the moon.

We actually expected that.

You can also expect that
if the moon transits

after the planet, then
the planet should come in

earlier than expected
because the barycenter,

the center of mass that lives
between the two of them,

kind of like on a
balancing arm between them.

And so we saw that as well.

So the phase signature matched up.

The mass of the moon was
measured to be Neptune mass

and the size of the moon was
measured to be Neptune radius.

And so everything just really lined up

and we spent months and
months trying to kill it.

This is my strategy for
anything interesting.

We just try to throw the
kitchen sink at it and say

we must be tricked by something.

And so we tried looking at the, you know,

the centroid motion of the telescope,

the different wavelength
channels have been observed,

the pixel level information.

And no matter what we did, we
just couldn't get rid of it.

And so we submitted to Science and I think

at the time Science, which
is one of the top journals,

said to us, would you
mind calling your paper

"Discovery of an Exomoon?"

And I had to push back and we said no,

we're not calling it that.

Even, despite everything we've done,

we're not calling it a discovery,

we're calling it evidence for an exomoon,

because for me I'd wanna
see this repeat two times,

three times, four times
before I really would bet

my house that this is the real deal.

And I do worry, as I said,

that perhaps that's my own skepticism,

self-skepticism going too far.

But I think it was the right decision.

And since that paper came out,

there has been continuous
interest in the subject.

Another team independently
analyzed that star

and recovered actually pretty much exactly

the same resources as us,

the same dip, the same
wobble of the planet.

And a third team looked
at it and they actually

got something different.

They saw the dip was diminished
compared to what we saw.

They saw a little hint of
a dip but not as pronounced

as what we saw, and they
saw the wobble as well.

So there's been a little bit of tension

about analyzing the
reduction of the Hubble data.

And so the only way my
mind to resolve this

is just to look again.

We actually did propose to Hubble straight

after that and we said,
look, if our model is right,

if the moon is there, it
came in late last time,

it transited after the planet.

Because of the orbit,

we can calculate that it should transit

before the planet next time.

If it's not there, if it
doesn't transit before,

and even if we see a dip afterwards,

we know that's not our moon.

It's obviously some instrumental
effect with the data.

We had a causal prediction as
to where the moon should be.

And so I was really excited about that.

But we didn't get the telescope time.

And unfortunately, if you
go further into the future,

we no longer have the
predictive capability

because it's like predicting the weather.

You might be able to predict
the weather next week

to some level of accuracy,

but predicting the weather next year

becomes incredibly hard.

The uncertainties just
grow and compound as you go

forward into the future, more and more.

- How are you able to know where the moon

would be positioned?

So you're able to tell the orbiting

like geometry and frequency?

- Yeah, so from the,

basically from the wobbles
of the planet itself,

that tells us the orbital
motion of the moon.

It's the reflex motion of
the moon up on the planet.

- But isn't it just an
estimate to where, like,

I'm concerned about you making
a strong prediction here

because like if you don't get the moon

where the moon leads

on the next time around,
if you did get Hubble time,

couldn't that mean something
else if you didn't see that?

Like, 'cause you said it
would be an instrumental,

I feel the strong urge
to disprove your own,

which is a really good imperative,

it's a good way to do science,

but like this is such
a noisy signal, right?

Or blurry signal, maybe?

Yeah, low resolution signal,
maybe that's the best-

- Yeah, I mean it's a five sigma signal.

So that's the slightly uncomfortable edge.

I mean, it's often said
that for any detection

of a first new phenomena,

you really want like a
20-25 sigma detection.

Then there's just no doubt that
what you're seeing is real.

This was at that edge.

I mean I guess it's
comparable to the Higgs boson,

but the Higgs boson was slightly different

'cause there was so much
theoretical impetus as to expect

a signal at that precise location.

And Neptune-sized moon was
not predicted by anyone.

No one, there was no papers you can find

that expect Neptune-sized moons

around Jupiter-sized planets.

So there's, I think we
were inherently skeptical

about its reality for that reason.

But this is science in
action and when we, you know,

we fit the wobbles,

we fit the dips and we have
this 3D geometric model

for the motion of the orbit
and projecting that forward

we found that about 80%
of our projections led

to the moon to be before.

So it's not 100%,

there was maybe 20% of the
cases it was over here.

But to me that was a
hard enough projection

that we felt confident
that we could refute the,

which was what I really
wanted, I wanted to refutable,

that's the basis of science,
a falsifiable hypothesis.

How can you make progress
on science if you don't have

a falsifiable testable hypothesis?

And so that was the beauty
of this particular case.

- So there's a numerical
simulation with a moon

that fits the data that we
observed and then you can

now make predictions
based on that simulation?

- Yeah.
- That's so cool. Okay.

- It's fun.

These are like little
solar systems that we can

simulate on the computer
and imagine their motions.

But we are pushing
things to the very limits

of what's possible.

And that's a double-edged sword.

It's both incredibly
exciting intellectually,

but you are always
risking, to some degree,

the pushing too far.

- So I'd like to ask you
about the recent paper

you co-authored,

"An exomoon survey of
70 cool giant exoplanets

and the new candidate Kepler-1708 b-i."

- I'd say there's like
three or four candidates

at this point, of which we
have published two of them.

And to me two are quite compelling,

and deserve follow up observations.

And so there are, to get
a confirmed detection,

at least in our case,

we would need to see it repeat for sure.

One of the problems with
some of the other methods

that have been proposed

is that you don't get that repeatability.

So for instance, an example
of a technique that would

lack that would be
gravitational microlensing.

So it is possible with a
new telescope coming up

in the future called

the Roman Space Telescope,
which is basically

a repurposed spy satellite that's the size

of the Hubble mirror going up into space.

It will stare at millions
of stars simultaneously.

And it will look to see
instead of whether any

of those stars get dimmer
for a short amount of time,

which will be a transit,
it'll look for the opposite.

It'll look to see if
anything get brighter,

and that brightness increase is caused

by another planetary
system passing in front

and then gravitationally
lensing light around it,

cause a brightening.

And so this is a method
of discovering an entire

solar system, but only for a glimpse.

You just get a short glimpse
of it passing like a,

you know, a ship sailing
through the night.

Just that one photo of it.

Now the problem with that is
that it's very difficult if,

you know, the physics of
gravitational lens are,

not surprisingly, quite complicated.

And so there's many,
many possible solutions.

So you might have a solution which is,

this could be a red dwarf star

with a Jupiter-like planet around it.

That's one solution.

But another solution is that's, let's say,

a free floating planet,

a rogue planet like
Jupiter with an Earth-like

moon around it.

And those two solutions are
almost indistinguishable.

Now, ideally we would be able
to repeat the observation,

we'd be able to go back and see, well,

if the moon really is there,

then we could predict its
mass and predict its motion

and expect it to be maybe over
here next time or something.

With microlensing, it's
a one snapshot event.

And so for me it's intriguing as a way

of revealing something about
the exomoon population,

but I always come back to transits

because it's the only
method we really have

that's absolutely repeatable,
that we'll be able

to come back and prove everyone,
prove to everyone that,

look, on the 17th of
October, the moon will be

over here and the moon will look like

this and we can actually
capture that image.

And that's what we see with,
of course, many exoplanets.

So we wanna get to that same
point of full confidence,

full confirmation, the slam dunk detection

of these exomoons.

But yeah, it's been a
hell of a journey to try

and push the field into that direction.

And...

- Is there some resistance
to the transit method?

- Not to the field transit
method, I just say to exomoons.

So the transit method is by far

the most popular method
for looking for exoplanets.

But yeah, as I've alluded to,

exomoons is kind of a niche topic

within the discipline of exoplanets.

And that's largely because
there are people like

I think are waiting for those slam dunks.

And it was like the,

if you go back to the
first exoplanet discovery

that was made in 1995

by Michel Mayor and Didier
Queloz, I think is true

at the time that they
were seen as mavericks,

that the idea of looking
for planets around stars

was considered fringe science.

And, you know, I'm sure
many colleagues told them,

why don't you do something more safe,

like study eclipsing stars
to binary star systems,

we know those exist,

so why are you wasting your
time looking for planets?

You're gonna get this
alien moniker or something,

you'll be seen as a
fringe maverick scientist.

And so I think it was quite difficult

for those early planet
hunters to get legitimacy

and be taken seriously.

And so very few people risked
their careers to do it,

except for those that were
either emboldened to try

or had maybe the career, maybe
like tenure or something,

so they didn't have to necessarily worry

about the implications of failure.

And so once that happened,

once they made the first
discoveries, overnight, you know,

everyone and their dog
was going into exoplanets

and all of a sudden the whole, you know,

the whole astronomy community
shifted and huge numbers

of people that were once
upon a time studying

eclipses and binaries, you know,

changed to becoming exoplanet scientists.

And so that was the first
wave of exoplanet scientists.

We now in a kind of a second wave,

or even the third wave
where people like me,

to some degree, kind of
grew up with the idea

of exoplanets as being normal.

You know, I was 11 years old, I guess,

when the first exoplanet was discovered.

And so to me it was a fairly
normal idea to grow up with.

And so we've been trained in exoplanets

from the very beginning.

And so that brings a different perspective

to those who have maybe transitioned

from a different career path.

And so, I suspect,

with exomoons and
probably technosignatures,

astrobiology many of the
topics which are seen

at the fringes of what's possible,

they will all open up into
becoming mainstream one day.

But there's a lot of people
who are just waiting,

waiting for that assuredness
that there is a secure

career net ahead of
them before they commit.

- Yeah.

It does seem to me that
exomoons open wider or open

for the first time the door to aliens.

So more seriously academically
studying, all right,

let's look at like alien worlds.

So I think it's still
pretty fringe to talk

about alien life, even though like

on Mars and the moons and
so on, you're kind of like,

you know, it'll be nice,

but imagine the first time
discover a living organism,

that's gonna change, then
everybody will look like

an idiot for not focusing
everything on this,

because the possibility
of the things will,

it's possible it might be super boring,

it might be very boring bacteria,

but even the existence of life elsewhere.

Some, I mean that changes everything.

That means life is everywhere.

- Yeah.

If you knew now that in 5 years,

10 years the first life would
be discovered elsewhere,

you knew that in advance,

it would surely affect
the way you approach

your entire career,

especially someone junior in astronomy.

You would surely be like, well,

this is clearly gonna
be the direction I have

to dedicate my classes and my training

and my education towards that direction.

- All the new textbooks,
all the... That's written.

I mean, and I think there's
a lot of value to hedging,

like allocating some of the
time to that possibility,

because the kind of discoveries
we might get in the next

few decades, it feels, what,

like we're on the verge of a lot of,

getting a lot of really
good data and having better

and better tools that
can process that data.

So there's just going to
be a continuous increase

of the kind of discoveries
that will open...

Like, but a slam dunk,
that's hard to come by.

- Yeah, I think a lot
of us are anticipating,

I mean we're already
seeing it to some degree

with Venus and the phosphine incident,

but we've seen

before with Bill Clinton
stood on the White House lawn

announcing life from Mars.

And there are inevitably
gonna be spurious claims

or at least claims which are
ambiguous to some degree.

There will be, for sure,

a high profile journal like

Nature or Science that will
one day publish a paper

saying biosignature
discovered or something like

that on TRAPPIST-1 or some other planet.

And then there will be
years of back and forth

in the literature.

And that might seem frustrating,

but that's how science works.

That's the mechanism of science at play,

of people scrutinizing the
resource to intense skepticism,

and it's like a crucible, you know,

you burn away all irrelevancies
until whatever is left

is the truth.

And so you are left with this
product, which is that, okay,

we either believe or don't believe

that biosignatures are there.

So there's inevitably gonna
be a lot of controversy

and debate and argument about it.

We just have to anticipate that.

And so I think you have to
basically have a thick skin

to some degree, academically,
to dive into that world.

And you are seeing that with phosphine...

It's been uncomfortable
to watch from the outside

the kind of dialogue that
some of the scientists have

been having with each other about that,

because-

- [Lex] They get a little aggressive.

- Yeah.

And you can understand why, because...

- Jealousy, I don't know?

That's me saying, not
you, that's me talking.

- I'm sure there's some
envy and jealousy involved

on the behalf of those who are not part

of the original discovery.

- [Lex] Sure.

- But there's also, in any
case, just leave, you know,

the particular people
involved in Venus alone,

in any case of making it
a claim of that magnitude,

especially life, because
life is pretty much one

of the biggest discoveries of all time

that you can imagine
scientifically, you can see,

and I'm so conscious in
myself when I get close to,

as I said, even the much
smaller goal of setting

an exomoon, the ego creep in.

And so as a scientist,

we have to be so guarded
against our own egos.

You see the lights in your eyes

of a Nobel Prize or the fame and fortune

and being remembered in the history books.

And we all grew up in
our training learning

about Newton and Einstein,

these giants of the
field, Feynman, Maxwell.

And you get the idea of these individual

contributions which get
immortalized for all time.

And that's seductive.

It's why many of us with a skillset to go

into maybe banking instead decided,

actually there's something about the idea

of being immortalized and
contributing towards society

in a permanent way that is more attractive

than the financial reward of
applying my skills elsewhere.

So to some degree that
ego can be a benefit,

'cause it brings in skillful
people into our field

who might otherwise be
tempted by money elsewhere.

But, on the other hand, it,
the closer you get towards,

when you start flirting

with that Nobel Prize in
your eyes or you think

you're on the verge of seeing something,

you can lose objectivity.

A very famous example of
this is Barnard's Star.

There was a planet claimed
there by Peter van de Kamp,

I think it was in 1968, '69.

And at the time it would've
been the first ever

exoplanet ever claimed.

And he felt assured that
this planet was there,

he was actually using
the wobbling star method,

but using the positions
of the stars to see them

to claim this exoplanet.

It turned out that this
planet was not there.

Subsequent analyses by both
dynamicists and theorists

and those looking at the instrumental data

established fairly unanimously
that there was no way

this planet was really there.

But Peter van de Kamp insisted it was

there despite overwhelming
evidence that was

accruing against him.

And even to the day he died,

which was I think in the early '90s,

he was still insisting
this planet was there,

even when we were
starting to make the first

genuine exoplanet discoveries.

And even at that point,

I think Hubble had even
looked at that star

and had totally ruled out any possibility

of what he was talking about.

And so that's a problem.

How do you get to a point as a scientist

where you just can't accept
anything that comes otherwise,

because it starts out
with the dream of fame

and then it ends in a stubborn
refusal to ever back down.

- Of course the flip
side of that is sometimes

you need that to have
the strength to carry

a belief against the
entire scientific community

that resists your beliefs.

And so it's a double-edged sword.

- That can happen, but it I guess

the distinction here is evidence.

So in this case that the
evidence was so overwhelming,

it wasn't really a
matter of interpretation.

It was, you had collected,

you'd observed this star
with, the same star,

but with maybe 10, even
100 times greater precision

for prolonged, much
longer periods of time.

And there was just no doubt
at this point this planet

was a mirage.

And so that's why you
have to be very careful.

I always say, don't ever name, you know,

my wife and my daughter, like,

name this planet after
me that you discover.

And I'm like, I can't ever name a planet

after you because I won't
be objective any more.

How could I ever turn
around to you and say

that planet wasn't real,
that I named after you.

- See, you're somebody that
talks about and is clear

in your eyes and in your
way of being that you love

the process of discovery,
that joy, the magic of just,

you know, seeing something, a
new observation, a new idea.

Right?

But I guess the point is,

when you have that great
feeling is to then switch

on the skepticism.

Like, to start like testing,
what does this actually mean?

Is this real?

What are the possible
different interpretations

that could make this a lot less grand

than I first imagined?

And all, so both have the
wonder and the skepticism all

in one brain.

- Yeah.

I think the generally the
more I want something to be

true the more I inherently doubt it.

And I think that just
comes from, you know,

I grew up with a religious
family and was just sort

of indoctrinated to some
degree, like many children are,

that, okay, there's just
normal that, you know,

there's a garden, this
is the way the world is,

God created the Earth.

And then as I became more, you know,

well-read and literate
of what was happening

in the world scientifically,
I started to doubt.

And it really just struck
me that the hardest thing

to let go of when you do
decide not to be religious

any more, and it's not really
like a light bulb moment,

but it just kind of happens
over sort of 11 to 13,

I think, for me it was happening,

but it's that sadness of letting go

of this beautiful dream
which you had in your mind

of eternal life for, you know,

for behaving yourself
on Earth, you would have

this beautiful heaven that you could go

to and live forever.

And that's very attractive.

And for me personally,

that was one of the things
that pulled me against it,

was this, it's like
it's too good to be true

and that it's very convenient that

this could be so,

and I have no evidence directly in terms

of a scientific sense to
support this hypothesis.

And it just became really
difficult to reconcile

my growth as a scientist,

and I know some people
find that reconciliation,

I have not, maybe I will one day,

but as a general guiding principle,

which I think I obtained
from that experience,

was that I have to be extremely guarded

about what I want to be true
because it's going to sway me

to say things which are not
true, if I'm not careful.

And that's not what we're
trying to do as scientists.

- So you felt from a religious perspective

that there was a little bit
of a gravitational field

in terms of your opinions,

like it was affecting how
you could be as a scientist?

Like as a scientific thinker,
obviously you were young.

- Yeah, I think that's true.

That whenever there's
something you want to be true,

it's the ultimate
seduction intellectually,

and I worry about this a lot
with, you know, UFOs and with,

it's true, already with things like

Venus and phosphine and searching
for astrological signals.

We have to guard against
this all the way through,

from however we're looking for life,

however we're looking for
whatever this big question is,

there is a part of us, I think,

I would love there to
be life in the universe,

I hope there is life in the universe,

but I'm somewhat been
on record several times

as being fairly firm
about trying to remain

consciously agnostic about that question.

I don't want to make up my
mind about what the answer is

before I've collected evidence
to inform that decision.

That's how science should work.

If I already know what the
answer is, then what am I doing?

And that's not a scientific
experiment any more.

You've already decided. So
what are you trying to learn?

What's the point of doing the experiment

if you already know what the
answer is, there's no point.

- It's so complicated because,

so if I'm being honest with myself,

when I imagine the universe,

so first thing I imagine
about our world is that we,

humans, and me, certainly,
as one particular human,

know very, my first
assumption is I know almost

nothing about how anything works.

So first of all,

that actually applies for things
that humans do know, like,

you know, quantum mechanics
and all the things

that there's different
expertises that I just have

not dedicated to.

So even that starting point.

But if we take all of knowledge
as human civilization,

we know almost nothing.

That's kind of an assumption I have,

because it seems like we
keep discovering mysteries

and it seems like history,

human history is defined by
moments when we said, okay,

we pretty much figured it all out,

and then you realize a
century later you've,

when you said that, you
didn't figure out anything.

Okay. So that's like a starting point.

The second thing I have is
I feel like the entirety

of the universe is just filled
with alien civilizations.

Statistically there's the important thing

that enables that belief for me

is that they don't have to be human-like,

they can be anything.

And it's just the fact that life exists

and just seeing the way life

is on Earth, that it just finds a way,

it finds a way in so many different

complicated environments, it finds a way,

whatever that force is,

that same force has to
find a way elsewhere also.

But then if I'm also being
honest and I don't know

how many hours in a day I
spend seriously considering

the possibility that we're alone.

I don't know, when my heart is,

and mind are filled with wonder,

I think about all the different
life that's out there.

But to really imagine that we're alone,

like really imagine,

all the vastness that's
out there, we're alone?

That not even bacteria?

- I would say you don't have
to believe that we are alone,

but you have to admit it's a possibility

about ignorance of the universe so far.

You can have a belief about something

in absence of evidence.

And Carl Sagan famously described

that as the definition of faith.

If you believe something
when there's no evidence,

you have faith that there's
life in the universe.

But you can't demonstrate,

you can't prove it mathematically,

you can't show me evidence of that.

- But is there some, so mathematically...

Math is a funny thing.

Is there's, I mean, the
way physicists think,

like intuition, so basic reasoning,

is there some value to that?

- You can certainly make
a very good argument,

I think you've kind of already made one,

just the vastness of the
universe is the default

argument that people often turn to,

that surely there should
be others out there.

It's hard to imagine.

There are an order of 10 to the 22 stars

in our observable universe.

And so really the question comes down

to what is the probability
of one of those 10 to the 22

planets, let's say Earth-like planets,

if they all have Earth-like planets,

going on to form life, spontaneously.

That's the process of abiogenesis,

the spontaneous emergence of life.

- [Lex] Also the word
spontaneous is the funny word.

- Well, again, maybe we
won't use spontaneous,

but not being, say, seeded by,

say, you know,

some other civilization
or something like this,

like it naturally emerges.

- Because even the word spontaneous makes

it seem less likely.
- Yeah.

- Like there's just this chemistry

and an extremely random process.

- It could be a very gradual
process over millions

of years of growing complexity
in chemical networks.

- Maybe there's a force in
the universe that pushes

it towards interesting
complexity, pockets of complexity,

that ultimately creates
something like life,

which we can't possibly define yet.

And sometimes it manifests
itself into something

that looks like humans,

but it could be a totally different kind

of computational information
processing system

that we're too dumb to even visualize.

- Yeah, I mean certainly,

I mean it's kind of weird
that complexity develops

at all, right?

Because it seems like the opposite

to our physical intuition,
training in physics,

of entropy that things should, you know,

complexity's hard to spontaneously evolve,

I shouldn't say spontaneously,

but hard to emerge in general.

And so that's an interesting problem.

I think there's been,

certainly from an
evolutionary perspective,

you do see growing complexity,
and there's a nice argument,

I think it's by Gould,
who shows that if you have

a certain amount of complexity,

it can either become less
complex or more complex

through random mutation.

And the less complex things
are stripping away something,

something that was necessary
potentially to their survival.

And so in general,

that's gonna be not particularly
useful in its survival.

And so it's gonna be detrimental to strip

away a significant amount
of its useful traits.

Whereas if you add something,

the most typical thing that
you add is probably not

useful at all.

It's probably just doesn't really affect

its survival negatively,
but it neither does

it provide any significant benefit.

But sometimes, on rare occasions,

of course it will be of benefit.

And so if you have a
certain level of complexity,

it's hard to go back in complexity,

but it's fairly easy to go
forward with enough bites

at the cherry, you will
eventually build up in complexity.

And that tends to be why
we see complexity grow

in certainly in an evolutionary sense,

but also perhaps it's
operating in chemical networks

that led to the emergence of life.

I guess the real problem I
have with the numbers game,

just to come back to that,

is that we are talking
about a certain probability

of that occurring.

It may be to go from the primordial soup,

however you wanna call it,

the ingredients that
the Earth started with,

the organic molecules,

the probability of going
from that initial condition

to something that was capable of Darwinian

natural selection that maybe
we could define as life,

the probability of that
is maybe 1% of the time

that happens, in which case you're right,

the universe will be
absolutely teeming with life,

but it could also be 10
to the power of minus 10,

in which case it's one per
galaxy or 10 to the power

of minus 100, in which case
the vast majority of universes,

even, do not have life within it.

- Or 90%.
- Or 90%.

- You said 1%, but it could
be 90% if the conditions

of the chemical conditions
of a planet are correct,

or a moon are correct.

- I admit that, it could
be any of those numbers.

And the challenge is,

we just have no rigorous reason to expect

why 90% is any...

'Cause we're talking about a
probability of probability.

Is 90% more a priori likely

than 10 to the power minus 20?

- Well, the thing is we
do have an observation,

N of 1, of Earth,

and it's difficult to
know what to do with that,

what kind of intuition
you build on top of that,

because on Earth it seems
like life finds a way,

in all kinds of conditions,

in all kinds of crazy conditions.

- [David] Good. Yeah.

- And it's able to like build
up from the basic chemistry,

you could say, okay,

maybe it takes a little
bit of time to develop

some complicated technology
like mitochondria,

I don't know, like photosynthesis, fine,

but it seems to figure it out
and like do it extremely well.

- Yeah.

But I would say you're
describing a different process.

I mean, maybe I'm at fault for separating

these two processes, but to me you are

describing basically
natural selection evolution

at that point.

Whereas I'm really describing abiogenesis,

which is to me a separate
distinct process.

- Do you limit it to
human scientists? Yes.

But why would it be a separate process?

Why is the birth of
life a separate process

from the process of life?

I mean we're uncomfortable,

we're uncomfortable with the Big Bang,

we're uncomfortable with
the first thing, I think,

like where does this come from?

- Right.

So I think, I would say I just
twist that question around

and say, you are saying why
is it a different process?

Why, and I would say,

why shouldn't it be a different process?

Which isn't really a good
defense except to say

that we have knowledge
of how natural evolution,

natural selection, evolution works.

We think we understand that process.

We have almost no information
about the earliest stages

of how life emerged on our planet.

It may be that you are
right and it is a part

of a continuum.

It may be that it is also
a distinct improbable set

of circumstances that led
to the emergence of life.

As a scientist, I'm just
trying to be open-minded

to both possibilities.

If I assert that life
must be everywhere, to me,

you run the risk of experimental bias.

If you think you know what the answer is,

if you look at an Earth-like planet

and you are pre-conditioned
to think there's a 90%

chance of life on this
planet, it's going to,

at some level, affect your
interpretation of that data.

Whereas if I, however
critical you might be

of the agnosticism that
I impose upon myself,

remain open to both possibilities,

then I trust in myself
to make a fair assessment

as to the reality of
that evidence for life.

- Yeah.

But I wonder sort of scientifically,

and that's really beautiful
to hear and inspiring to hear,

I wonder scientifically how
many firsts we truly know of,

like, and then we don't eventually explain

as actually a step number

1 million in a long process.

So I think that's a
really interesting thing

if there's truly first in
this universe, like, you know,

for us, whatever happened at the Big Bang

is a kind of first, the origin of stuff.

But it just, again,

it seems like history
shows that we'll figure

out that it's actually a
continuation of something,

but then physicists say
that time is emergent,

and then our causality and
time is a very human kind

of construct, that it's very
possible that all of this,

so there could be really firsts of a thing

to which we attach a name...

So whatever we call life,
maybe there is an origin of it.

- Yeah.

And I would also say I'm
open to the idea of it being

part of a continuation,

but the continuation maybe is more broader

and it's a continuation
of chemical systems

and chemical networks.

And the what we call
this one particular type

of chemistry in this
behavior of chemistry life,

but it is just one manifestation
of all the trillions

of possible permutations in which chemical

reactions can occur.

And we assert specialness to
it because that's what we are.

It's also true of intelligence,

you could extend the same
thing and say, you know,

we are looking for intelligent
life in the universe,

and then you sort of, well, where does,

where do you define intelligence?

Where's that continuum of something

that's really like us?

Are we alone?

There may be a continuum
of chemical systems,

a continuum of intelligences out there,

and we have to be careful
of our own arrogance

of assuming specialness about what we are,

that we are some distinct
category of phenomena,

whereas the universe doesn't really care

about what category we are,

it's just doing what it's
doing and doing everything in,

you know, infinite diversity and infinite

combinations essentially what it's doing.

And so we are taking this
one slice and saying, no,

this has to be treated separately.

And I'm open to the idea that it could be

a truly separate phenomena,
but it may just be

like a snowflake.

Every snowflake's different.

It may just be that this
one particular iteration

is another variant of the vast continuum.

- Yeah.

Maybe the algorithm of
natural selection itself

is an invention of Earth.

I kind of also tend to suspect that this,

whatever the algorithm
is that kind of operates

at all levels throughout the universe.

But maybe this is a very
kind of peculiar thing

that where there's a
bunch of chemical systems

that compete against each
other somehow for survival

under limited resources,

and that's a very Earth-like thing.

We have a nice balance of,

there's a large number of resources,

enough to have a bunch of different kinds

of systems competing, but not
so many that they get lazy.

And maybe that's why
bacteria were very lazy

for a long time.

Maybe they didn't have much competition.

- Quite possibly.

I mean I try to,

as fun as it is to get
into the speculation

about the definitions of
life and what life does

and this gross network of possibilities.

Honestly for me, the strongest argument

for remaining agnostic
is to avoid that bias

in assessing data.

And we've seen it, I mean first of all,

Lowel, I talked about on my channel,

and maybe last year or
two years ago, you know,

he's a very famous astronomer
who in the 19th century

was claiming the evidence
of canals on Mars.

And from him, from his perspective

and even at the time culturally,

it was widely accepted that Mars would,

of course, have life.

I mean I think it seems silly to us,

but it was kind of similar arguments

to what we're using now
about exoplanets, that, well,

of course there must be
life in the universe,

how could it just be here?

And so it seemed obvious to
people that when you looked

at Mars where it's polar caps,

even if you know its
atmosphere had seasons,

it seemed obvious to them
that too would be a place

where life not only was present,

but had emerged to a
civilization which actually

was fairly comparable in
technology to our own,

'cause it was building canal systems.

Of course a canal system seems a bizarre

technosignature to us, but it
was a product of their time,

to them that was the
cutting edge in technology.

It should be a warning
shot actually a little bit

for us that if we think, you know,

solar panels or building
Starlinks or whatever,

space mining is like an
inevitable technosignature,

that may be laughably antiquated compared

to what other civilizations
far more advanced than us

may be doing.

And so anyway, Percival Lowell,

I think was a product of his
time that he thought life

was there, inevitably he even
wrote about it extensively.

And so when he saw these lines,

these linea on the surface
of Mars, to him it was

just obvious they were canals,

that was experimental bias playing out.

He was told, for one,

that he had basically the
greatest eyesight out of any

of his peers and
ophthalmologists had taught him

that in Boston, that his eyesight was,

you know, absolutely spectacular.

So he just was convinced
everything he saw was real.

And secondly, he was convinced
there was life there.

And so to him, it just added up.

And then that kind of wasted, you know,

decades of research of
treating the idea of Mars

being inhabited by this
canal civilization.

But the other hand,

it's maybe not a waste
'cause there is a lesson

in history of how we should
be always on guard against

our own preconceptions
and biases about what...

Whether life is out there
and furthermore what types

of things life might do if it is there.

- If I were running this simulation,

which we'll also talk
about 'cause you make

the case against it, but if I
were running the simulation,

I would definitely put you
in a room with an alien

and just to see you mentally
freak out for hours at a time.

For sure you for sure would've thought

you will be convinced that
you've lost your mind.

I mean you, no, not that,

but I mean like if we discover life,

we discovered interesting
new physical phenomena,

I think the right approach
is definitely to be

extremely skeptical and be very,

very careful about things
you want to be true.

That's, that's really-

- Yeah, I would say I'm not like

some extreme denialist of evidence.

If there was compelling evidence for life

on another planet, I
would be the first one

to be celebrating that.

And be shaking hands with the alien

on the White House lawn,
whatever, that would be...

You know, I grew up with Star
Trek and that was my fantasy,

was to, you know,

be Captain Kirk and fly across the stars

meeting other civilizations.

So there's nothing more I'd
want to be true as I've said,

but we just have to guard against it

when we're assessing data.

But I have to say I'm very skeptical

that we will ever have
that Star Trek moment.

Even if there are other
civilizations out there,

they're never gonna be at a point

which is in technological
lockstep with us,

similar level of development,
even intellectually,

the idea that they could
have a conversation with us,

even through a translator, I mean,

we can't communicate with humpback whales,

we can't communicate with
dolphins in a meaningful way,

we can sort of bark orders at them,

but we can't have abstract conversations

with them about things.

And so the idea that we will ever have

that fulfilling conversation,
I'm deeply skeptical of,

and I think a lot of us are drawn to that.

It is maybe a replacement
for God to some degree,

that father figure civilization
that might step in,

teach us the error

of our ways and bestow
wisdom upon our civilization.

But they could equally be
a giant fungus that has,

doesn't even understand
the idea of socialization

because it's the only
entity on its planet.

It just swells over the entire surface.

And it doesn't, it's
incredibly intelligent

because maybe each node
communicates with each other

to create essentially a giant neural net,

but it has no sense of
what communication even is.

And so alien life is out
there is surely gonna

be extremely diverse.

I'm pretty skeptical that we'll ever get

that fantasy moment I always
had as a kid of having

a dialogue with another civilization.

- So dialogue. Yes.

What about noticing them?
What about noticing signals?

Do you hope, so one
thing we've been talking

about is getting
signatures, biosignatures,

technosignatures about other planets.

Maybe if we're extremely
lucky in our lifetime to be

able to meet lifeforms,

get evidence of living or dead life forms

on Mars or moons of Jupiter and Saturn.

What about getting
signals from outer space?

Interstellar signals?

What would those signals
potentially look like?

- That's a hard question to answer

because we are essentially
engaging in xenopsychology

to some degree.

What are the activities
of another civilization?

A lot of that is-

- [Lex] What does the word xenopsychology,

I apologize to interrupt, mean.

- Well, and maybe I'm just
fabricating that word,

really, but it's trying to
guess at the machinations

and motivations of
another intelligent being

that was completely
evolutionary divorced from us.

- So it's like you said,

exomoons, exopsychology, extrasolar...

- Yeah.
- Psychology.

- Yeah, alien psychology is
another way of maybe making

it more grounded, but

we can't really guess at
their motivations too well,

but we can look at the
sorts of behaviors we engage

in and at least look for them.

We're always guilty that when
we look for biosignatures,

we are really looking for,

and even when we look for planets,

we're looking for templates of Earth.

When we look for biosignatures,

we're looking for templates
of Earth-based life.

When we look for technosignatures,

we tend to be looking for
templates of our own behaviors

or extrapolations of our behaviors.

So there's a very long
list of technosignatures

that people have suggested
we could look for.

The earliest ones where, of course,

radio beacons that were sort

of Project Ozma that Frank
Drake was involved in,

trying to look for radio signatures,

which could either be just
like blurting out high

power radio signals,
saying, hey, we're here.

Or could even have encoded within them

galactic encyclopedias for us to unlock,

which has always been the
allure of the radio technique.

But there could also be
unintentional signatures.

For example, you could have something like

the satellite system that
we've produced around

the Earth, the artificial
satellite system,

Starlink type systems.

We mentioned that you
could detect the glint

of lights across those
satellites as they orbit

around the planet.

You could detect a
geostationary satellite belt

which would block out
sunlight as the planet

transferred across the star.

You could detect solar
panels, potentially,

spectorally on the surface of the planet.

Heat island effects.

New York is hotter than
New York State by a couple

of degrees 'cause the heat
island effect to the city.

And so you could thermally
map different planets

and detect these.

So there's a large array
of things that we do

that we can go out and
hypothesize we could look for.

And then on the furthest end of the scale,

you have things which go
far beyond our capabilities,

such as warp drive signatures,
which have been proposed.

You get these bright flashes of light

or even gravitational
wave detections from LIGO

could be detected.

You could have Dyson spheres.

The idea of covering,

basically a star is completely
covered by some kind

of structure which collects
all the light from the star

to power the civilization.

And that would be pretty easily
detectable, to some degree,

'cause you're transferring all

of the visible light, thermodynamically,

it has to be remitted so it would come

out as infrared light.

So you'd have an incredibly
bright infrared star,

yet one that was visibly
not present at all.

And so that would be
pretty intriguing signature

to look for.

- Yeah.

But is there efforts to look
for something like that,

for Dyson spheres out there, for,

with the strong infrared signal?

- There has been one,
yeah, there has been.

And there's been, I think in the,

literally there was one
with the IRAS satellite,

which is an infrared satellite.

They targeted, I think,

on the order of 100,000 stars,

nearby stars and found no convincing

examples of what looked
like a Dyson sphere star.

And then Jason Wright and
his team extended this

I think using WISE, which is
another infrared satellite,

to look around galaxies.

So could an entire galaxy
have been converted

into Dyson spheres or
a significant fraction

of the galaxy?

Which is basically the
Kardashev type III, right?

This is the, when you've
basically mastered

the entire galactic pool of resources.

And again, out of 100,000 nearby galaxies,

there appears to be no compelling examples

of what looks like a Dyson galaxy,

if you wanna call it that.

So that by no means proves
that they don't exist

or don't happen.

But it seems like it's an unusual behavior

for a civilization to get
to that stage of development

and start harvesting
the entire star output.

- Unusual, yes.

I, and I mean LIGO is super interesting

with gravitational waves.

If that kind of experiment
could start seeing

some weirdness, some weird signals,

that compare to the power
of cosmic phenomena.

- Yeah. Yeah.

I mean it's a whole new
window to the universe.

Not just in terms of
astrophysics but potentially

for technosignatures as well.

I have to say, with the
warp drives, I am skeptical

that warp drives are possible
because you have kind

of fundamental problem of relativity.

You can either really have relativity,

faster than light travel or causality.

You can only choose two
of those three things.

You really can't have all
three in a coherent universe.

If you have all three,

you basically end up with
a possibility of these kind

of temporal paradoxes and time loops

and grandfather paradoxes.

- Well can't there be
pockets of causality?

Something like that.

Like where there's like pockets
of consistent causality?

- You could design it in that way.

You could be, you know,

if you had a warp drive or
a time machine essentially,

you could be, you know,

you could be very conscious
and careful of the way

you use it so as to not to
cause paradoxes or just do

it in a local area or something.

But the real fundamental
problem is you always have

the ability to do it.

And so in a vast cosmic universe,

if time machines are all over the place,

there's too much risk of
someone doing it, right?

Of somebody having the option
of essentially breaking

the universe with this.

So this says a fundamental problem.

Hawking has this chronology
protection conjecture

where he said that essentially

this just can't be allowed
'cause it breaks all

our laws of physics if
time travel is possible.

- Current laws of physics. Yes.

- Correct. Yeah.

And so we'd need to rip up relativity.

I mean that's the point is
the current laws of physics.

So you'd have to rip up our
current law of relativity

to make sense of how FTL
could live in that universe.

'Cause you can't have relativity,

FTL and causality sit nicely
and play nicely together.

- But we're currently don't
have quantum mechanics

and relativity playing
nice together anyway,

so it's not like everything
is all a nice little fabric.

- It's certainly not the full picture.

There must be more to go.

- Yeah. So it's already ripped up.

So might as well rip it up a little more,

and in the process actually
try to connect the two things

'cause maybe in the unification

of the standard model
and general relativity,

maybe there lies some kind of new wisdom

about warp drives.

So by the way,

warp drives is somehow
messing with the fabric

of the universe to be
able to travel faster

than the speed of light?

- Yeah. You're basically
bending space-time.

You could also do it with a
wormhole or tachyon, you know,

some of the hypothetical FTL.

So doesn't have to necessarily
be the Alcubierre drive,

the warp drive.

It could be any faster than light system.

As long as it travels superluminally,

it will violate causality.

- And presumably that would
be observable with LIGO.

- Potentially. Yeah, potentially.

Depends on, I think, you know,

the properties of whatever
the spacecraft is.

I mean one problem with warp drives is,

there's all sorts of problems
with warp drives, but-

- [Lex] I like the start of
that sentence, one problem,

the warp drive.

- There's just this one
minor problem that we have

to get around.

But when it arrives at its destination,

it basically collects this vast,

basically has like an event horizon almost

at the front of it.

And so it collects all this radiation

at the front as it goes.

And when it arrives,

all that radiation gets
dumped on its destination,

would basically completely
exterminate the planet

it arrives at, that
radiation is also incident

within the shell itself.

There's Hawking radiation
occurring within the shell,

which is pretty dangerous.

And then, you know, also has,

it raises all sorts of exacerbations

of the Fermi paradox of course as well.

So you might be able to
explain why we don't see

a galactic empire.

I mean, even here it's hard.

You might be able to
explain why we don't see

a galactic empire, if
everybody's limited to Voyager 2

rocket speeds of like 20 kilometers per

second or something.

But it's a lot harder to
explain why we don't see

the stars populated by galactic
empires when warp drive

is imminently possible,
because it makes expansion

so much more trivial that...

It makes our life harder.

There's some wonderful
simulation work being done

out of Rochester where
they actually simulate all

the stars and the galaxy,
or a fraction of them,

and they spawn a
civilization in one of them

and they let it spread
out at sub-light speeds.

And actually the very mixing
of the stars themselves,

'cause the stars are not static,

they're in orbit of the galactic center

and they have crossing
paths with each other.

If you just have a range of
even like five light years

and your speed is of order
of a few percent the speed

of light is the maximum you can muster,

you can populate the entire
galaxy within something

like 100,000 to about
a million years or so.

So a fraction of the lifetime
of the galaxy itself.

And so this raises some
fairly serious problems,

because if any civilization
in the entire history

of the galaxy decide to
do that, then, you know,

either we shouldn't be
here or we happen to live

in this kind of rare
pocket where they chose not

to populate to.

And so this is sometimes
called fact A, it's fact A,

as you know, the fact A is
that a civilization is not

here now, an alien civilization has not,

is not in present occupation of the Earth.

And that's difficult to
resolve with the apparent ease

at which even a small
extrapolation of our own

technology could potentially
populate a galaxy

in far faster than galactic history.

- So to me, by the way, yeah,

the Fermi paradox is
truly a paradox for me.

But I suspect that if an
alien visited Earth, I suspect

if they do, if they are everywhere,

I think they're already here
and we're too dumb to see it.

But leaving that aside...

I think we should be
able to, in that case,

have very strong obvious signals

when we look up at the stars,

at the emanation of energy required,

we would see some weirdness that like,

where these are these kinds
of stars and these are

these kinds of stars that
are being messed with.

Like leveraging the
nuclear fusion of stars

to do something useful.

Right?

Like the fact that we don't
really see that, like,

maybe you can correct me.

Wouldn't we be able to,

if there is like alien
civilizations running galaxies,

wouldn't we see weirdnesses
from an astronomy

perspective with the way
the stars are behaving?

- Yeah, I mean,

it depends on exactly what they're doing.

But I mean the Dyson sphere example is one

that we already discuss,

where a survey of 100,000
nearby galaxies find

that they have all been transformed

into Dyson sphere collectors.

You could also imagine them

doing things like, we wrote
a paper like this recently,

of star lifting, where
you can extend the life

of your star by scooping
mass off the star.

So you'd be, you know,

doing stellar engineering essentially.

Space, if you're doing a huge
amount of asteroid mining,

you would have a spectral signature 'cause

you're basically filling
the Solar System with dust

by doing that, there'd be
debris from that activity.

And so there are some limits on this.

Certainly we don't see,
you know, bright flashes,

which would be, you know,

one of these consequences
of warp drives, as I said,

is as they decelerate,

they produce these
bright flashes of light.

We don't seem to see evidence
of those kind of things.

We don't see anything obvious
around the nearby stars

or the stars that we've
surveyed in detail beyond

that indicate any kind of
artificial civilization.

The closest maybe we had was
Boyajian's Star, there was

a lot of interest in,

there was a star that was
just very peculiarly dipping

in and out of its brightness.

And it was hypothesized for
a time that may indeed be

some kind of Dyson like structure.

So maybe a Dyson's
sphere that's half built.

And so as it comes in and out,

it's blocking out huge swaths of the star.

It was very difficult to
explain really with any kind

of planet model at the time.

But an easier hypothesis
that was proposed was

it could just be a large
number of comets or dust

or something, or maybe a
planet that had broken apart.

And as its fragments orbit
around, it blocks out starlight.

And it turned out with
subsequent observations

of that star, which especially the amateur

astronomy community made a
big contribution to as well,

that the dips were chromatic,

which was a real important
clue that probably wasn't

a solid structure then
that was going around it,

it was more likely to be
dust, dust is chromatic,

by chromatic I mean it looks
different in different colors.

So it blocks out more red
light than blue light.

If it was a solid structure,
it shouldn't do that.

It should be opaque, right?

A solid metal structure or something.

So that was one of the clear indications.

And the behavior of in
the way the light changed

or the dips changed across
wavelength was fully

consistent with the expectations

of what small particulates would do.

And so that's very hard.

I mean the real problem with
alien hunting, the real-

- This is the technical term?
- This is the real problem.

- The one problem,

the one problem with the
warp drive and the one

problem with alien hunting.

Yes.

- But, well, I, actually,

I'd say there's three big
problems for me with any

search for life, which
includes UFOs or the way

to fossils on Mars is that aliens

have three unique
properties as a hypothesis.

One is they have essentially

unbounded explanatory capability.

So there's almost no
phenomenon I can show you

that you couldn't explain
with aliens to some degree.

You could say, well the
aliens just have some super

high tech way of creating that illusion.

The second one would be
unbounded avoidance capacity.

So I might see a UFO tomorrow

and then the next day
and then the next day

and then predict I should
see it on Thursday at the end

of the week, but then I don't see it.

But I could always get
out of that and say, well,

that's just because they
chose not to come here.

You know, they can always avoid

future observations fairly easily.

If you survey an exoplanet
for biosignatures

and you don't see oxygen,
you don't see methane,

that doesn't mean there's
no one living there.

They could always be either
tricking their atmosphere,

engineering it, we actually
wrote a paper about that,

how you can use lasers to
hide your bio-signatures

as an advanced civilization,

or you could just be living
underground or underwater

or something where
there's no biosignatures.

So you can never really
disprove there's life

on another planet or on another star.

It has infinite avoidance.

And then finally the
third one is that we have

incomplete physical
understanding of the universe.

So if I see a new phenomena,

which Boyajian's Star was
a good example of that,

we saw this new phenomena
of these strange dips we'd

never seen before, it was
hypothesized immediately

this could be aliens, it's
like a god of the gaps,

but it turned out to be
incomplete physical understanding.

And so that happens all the time.

In the first pulsar that
was discovered, same story,

Jocelyn Bell kind of
somewhat tongue in cheek

called it Little Green Man I,

because it looked a lot like

the radiosignature that was
expected from a civilization.

But of course it turned out
to be a completely new type

of star that we had never seen before,

which was a neutron star,

with these two jets
coming out the top of it.

And so that's a challenge,
those three things are really,

really difficult in terms
of experimental design

for a scientist to work around,

something that can explain
anything, can avoid anything,

so it's almost unfalsifiable
and could always just be,

to some degree, as you said,

we have this very limited knowledge

of the infinite
possibilities of physical law

and we are probably only
scratching the surface, each time,

and we've seen it so often his in history,

we may just be detecting
some new phenomena.

- Well that last one,

I think I'm a little more
okay with making mistakes on.

- Yeah.
- Because it's exciting still.

- Yeah, but it's because no matter,

so you might exaggerate the
importance of the discovery,

but the whole point is
to try to find stuff

in this world is weird and try

to characterize that weirdness.

Sure you can throw little
green men as a label on it,

but eventually, it, like,

it's as mysterious and as
beautiful as interesting

as little green men.

Like we tend to think that
there's some kind of threshold,

but like there's all
kinds of weird organisms

on this Earth that
operate very differently

than humans that are super interesting.

The human mind is super interesting.

I mean like weirdness and complexity

is as interesting in any of its
forms as what we might think

from Hollywood what aliens are.

So like that, that's okay,

looking for weirdnesses on Mars...

- That's one of the
best sales pitches to do

technosignature work is that, you know,

we always have that as our fallback, that,

look, we're gonna look for
alien signatures, if we fail,

we're gonna discover
some awesome new physics

along the way.

And so even a,

even any kind of signature
that we detect is always

going to be interesting.

And so that compels us

to have not only the question

of looking for life in the
universe, but it gives us

a strong scientific grounding

as to why this sort of
research should be funded

and should be executed.

'Cause it always pushes the
frontiers and knowledge.

- I wonder if we'll be able
to discover and be open

enough to a broad definition of aliens,

where we see some kind of technosignature,

basically like a Turing test,

like this thing is intelligent,

like it's processing information
in a very interesting way.

But you could say that about chemistry,

you could say that about
physics, maybe not physics,

chemistry, like interesting
complex chemistry,

you could say that this is processing,

this is storing information,

this is propagating
information over time...

It's a gray area

between a living organism
that we would call an alien,

and a thing that's super
interesting and it's able

to carry some kind of intelligence.

- Yeah, information is a
really useful way to frame

what we're looking for though because

then you are divorced
from making assumptions

about even a civilization necessarily

or anything like that.

So any kind of information
or signature, indeed

you can take things like the light curve

from Boyajian's Star and ask
what is the minimum number

of free parameters or the
minimum information content

that must be encoded
within the slide curve.

And the hope is that maybe from, you know,

a good example would be
from a radiosignature,

you just detect something
that has, you know,

1000 megabytes of parameters essentially

contained within it.

That's pretty clearly at
that point not the product

of a natural process,

really any natural process
that we could possibly

imagine with our current
understanding of the universe.

And so thinking, even if we
can't decode, which, actually,

I'm skeptical we would
be able to ever decode it

in our lifetimes,

it would probably take decades
to fully ever figure out

what they're trying to tell us,

but if there was a message there,

we could at least know that there is high

information content
and there is complexity

and that this is a
attempt of communication,

information transfer and leave it

to our subsequent
generations to figure out

what exactly it is they're trying to say.

- What, again, a wild
question and thank you for...

- Entertaining them.
- Entertaining them.

I really, really appreciate that.

But what kind of signal in our lifetime,

what kind of thing do
you think might happen,

could possibly happen where
the scientific community

would be convinced

that there's alien
civilizations out there?

Like what?

So you already said maybe
a strong infrared signature

for something like a Dyson sphere.

- That, yeah, that's possibly,

that's also to some degree a little

bit ambiguous, because...

- That's the challenge,
sorry to interrupt,

is where your brain would be,

like you as a scientist would be like,

I know it's ambiguous
but this is really weird.

- Yeah.

I think if you had something,

I can imagine something
like a prime number sequence

or a mathematical sequence
like the Fibonacci series,

something being-
- Mathematically provable

that this is not a physical phenomena.

- Right.

I mean, yeah, prime numbers
is a pretty good case

because there's no natural
phenomena that produces

prime number sequences.

It seems to be a purely
an abstract mathematical

concept as far as I'm aware.

And so if we detected, you know,

a series of radio blips that
were following that sequence,

it would be pretty clear
to me, or it could even be,

you know, Carl Sagan suggested
that Pi could be encoded

in that, or you might
use the hydrogen line

but multiplied by Pi, like
some very specific frequency

of the universe, like a hydrogen line,

but multiply it by a abstract
mathematical constant,

that would imply strongly
that there was someone

behind the scenes operating that.

- Sorry, stored in which phenomena though?

- In that case, it's more of a radio wave.

But the information, I mean,

we kind of toyed with this idea

in a video idea about
hypothetical civilization

on my channel, but one kind of fun way,

I do wanna bring

this conversation
towards time a little bit

and thinking about not
just looking for life

and intelligence around us right now,

but looking into the past
and even into the future

to some degree or
communicating with the future.

And so we had this fun
experiment of imagining

a civilization that was
born at the beginning

of the history of the
galaxy and being the first

and what it would be like for them.

And they were desperately
searching for evidence

of life but couldn't find it.

And so they decided to try
and leave something behind

for future civilizations to discover,

to tell them about themselves.

But of course the radio
signal's just not gonna work

there because it has have a power source

and that's a piece of machinery,

it's gonna eventually break down,

it's gonna be hard to
maintain that for billions

of years timescale.

And so you wanted something
that was kind of passive,

that doesn't require an
energy source but can

somehow transmit information,
which is hard to think

about something that
satisfies those criteria.

But there was a proposal
by one of my colleagues,

Luc Arnold, which inspired a lot of us

in technosignatures and he
suggested that you could

build artificial transistors.

So you could build sheets of material

that transit in front of the star,

maybe one thin sheet passes
across first, then two,

then three, then five and seven,

so you could follow the
permanent sequence of these.

And so there'd be a clear
indication that someone

had manufactured those,
but they don't require any

energy source because they're
just sheets of material

in orbit of the star.

They would eventually
degrade from micrometeorites

and maybe that orbits
would become destabilized,

but they should have
lifetimes far exceeding

the lifetime of any battery or mechanical

electronic system that we could,

at least without energy
conceive of building.

And so you could imagine then extending

that and how could you
encode not just a prime

number sequence, but maybe
in the spatial pattern

of this very complex light curve we see,

you could encode more and more information

through 2D shapes and the
way those occultations happen

and maybe you could even encode messages

and in-depth information
from the, you know,

you could even imagine it
being like a lower layer

of information, which is just
the prime number sequence,

but then you look closely
and you see the smaller

divots embedded within those
that have a deeper layer

of information to extract.

And so to me something like that would be

pretty compelling that that
was somebody who would manage,

unless it's just a very impressive hoax,

that would be a pretty compelling evidence

for this civilization.

- And actually the methods
of astronomy right now

are kind of marching
towards being able to better

and better detect a signal like that.

- Yeah, I mean to some
degree it's just building

bigger aperture in space.

The bigger the telescope,

the finer ability to detect
those minute signals.

- Do you think the current sort

of the scientific community,
another weird question,

but just the observations
that are happening now,

do you think they're ready
for a prime number sequence?

In the sort of, if we're
using the current method,

the transit timing variation method,

like do you think you're ready?

Do you have the tools to detect
the prime number sequence?

- Yeah, for sure.

I mean there's 200,000
stars that Kepler monitored

and it monitored them all the time.

It took a photo of each one
of them every 30 minutes,

measured their brightness
and it did that for four

and a half years.

And so you have already,

and TESS is doing it right
now, another mission.

And so you have already an
existing catalog and people

are genuinely scouring through
each of those light curves

with automated machine
learning techniques,

we even developed some in our own team,

that can look for weird behavior.

We wrote a code called The
Weird Detector, for instance,

that-
- Of course.

- You know, it was just the
most generic thing possible.

Don't assume anything
about the signal shape,

just look for anything that repeats,

the signal, so it can be anything,

can we kind of learn the
template of the signal

from the data itself, and then we,

it's like a template
matching filter to see

if that repeats many,
many times in the data.

And so we actually applied
that and found a bunch

of interesting stuff, but
we didn't see anything

that was the prime number sequence,

at least in the Kepler data.

That's 200,000 stars,
which sounds like a lot,

but compared to 200 billion stars

in the Milky Way, it's really
just scratching the surface.

- So one, 'cause there
could be something much

more generalizable than
the prime number sequence,

it's ultimately the question of a signal

that's very difficult to
compress in the general sense

of what compress means.

So maybe as we get
better and better machine

learning methods that
automatically figure out,

analyze the data to
understand how to compress it,

just you'll be able to discover data

that's for some reason
it's not compressible.

But then, you know,

compression really is a
bottomless pit because like

that's really what intelligence is,

is being able to compress information.

- Yeah, and to some degree
the more you, I would imagine,

I don't work in compression algorithms,

but I would imagine the more
you compress your signal,

the more assumptions
that kind of go on behalf

of the decoder, the more
skilled they really have to be,

you know, some of the...

A permanent sequence

is completely unencoded
information essentially.

But if you look at the Arecibo message,

they were fairly careful
with their pixelation

of this simple image they sent to try

and make it as interpretable
as possible, to be,

that even a dumb alien
would be able to figure

out what we're trained to show them here.

Because there's all sorts
of conventions and rules

that are built in,

that we tend to presume
when we design our messages.

And so if your message is,

assuming they know how
to do an MP3 decoder,

particularly decompression
algorithm, I'm sure

they could eventually reverse engineer

it and figure it out.

But you are making it harder
for them to get to that point.

So maybe, I was thinking, you know,

you probably would have
a two-tier system, right?

You'd probably have some
lower tier key system

and then maybe beneath
that you'd have a deeper

compressed layer of more
in depth information.

- What about maybe observing physical,

actual physical objects?

So first let me go to your tweet

as a source of inspiration.

You tweeted that, it's
interesting to ponder

that if Oort clouds are
ever mined by the systems

of alien civilizations,
mining equipment from billions

of years ago could be in our Oort cloud,

since the Oort clouds are,
they extend really, really,

really, really far
outside the actual star.

That, so you know, mining equipment,

just like basic boring
mining equipment out there.

I dunno if there's
something interesting to say

about Oort clouds themselves
that are interesting

to you and about possible non-shiny

light emitting mining equipment
from alien civilization.

- Yeah, I mean, that thought,

I mean that's kind of
the beauty of the field

of technosignatures and
looking for life is you can

find inspiration and intellectual joy

in just the smallest
little thing that starts

a whole thread of building
upon it and wondering

about the implications.

And so in this case, I
was just really struck by,

we kind of mentioned this
a little bit earlier,

the idea that stars are not static.

We tend to think of the
galaxy as having stars

in a certain location from
the center of the galaxy

and they kind of live there.

But in truth the stars are
not only orbiting around

the center of the galaxy,

but those orbits are themselves changing,

over time they're processing.

And so in fact the orbits
might look more like

a spirograph if you've
ever done those as a kid,

they kind of whirl around
and trace out all sorts

of strange patterns and
so the stars intersect

with one another.

And so the current closest star to us

is Proxima Centauri,

which is about 4.2 light years away,

but it will not always
be the closest star.

Over millions of years
it will be supplanted

by other stars, in fact,

stars that will come even closer

than Proxima, within just
a couple of light years.

And that's been happening,

not just we can project that
will happen over the next

few million years, but
that's been happening

presumably throughout the
entire history of the galaxy

for billions of years.

And so if you went back
in time it, you know,

there would've been all sorts
of different nearest stars,

right, at different stages
of the Earth's history.

And those stars are so
close that their Oort clouds

do intermix with one another.

So the, Oort cloud can extend
out to even a light year

or two around the Earth.

There's some debate about
exactly where it ends.

It probably doesn't really
have a definitive end

but kind of more just kind
of peters out more and more

and more and more as you go further away.

- Yeah. Further away.

For people who don't know an Oort cloud,

I don't know what the
technical definition is,

but a bunch of rocks that kind of, no,

objects that orbit the star

and they can extend really,
really far because of-

- These are objects that
probably are mostly icy rich.

They were probably formed
fairly similar distances

to Jupiter and Saturn, but were scattered

out through the interactions
of those giant planets.

We see a circular disc
of objects around us,

which kind of looks like the asteroid belt

but just further away
called the Kuiper belt.

And then further beyond
that you get the Oort cloud

and the Oort cloud is not in
a disk, it's just a sphere,

it kind of surrounds us in all directions.

So these are objects that
were scattered out through,

three dimensionally, in
all different directions.

And so those objects are
potentially resources for us.

Especially if you were planning to do

an interstellar emission one day,

you might want to mine
the water that's embedded

within those and use that
as either oxygen or fuel

for your rocket.

And so it's quite possible,

there's also some rare
Earth metals and things like

that as well, but there's quite possible

that a civilization might
use Oort cloud objects

as a jumping off point,

or in the Kuiper belt you have
things like Planet Nine even,

there might even be objects
beyond in the Oort cloud

which are actually planet like
that we just cannot detect.

These objects are very, very faint.

So that's why they're so hard to see.

I mean even Planet Nine,

it's hypothesized to exist
but we've not been able

to confirm its existence
because it's something like

1000 AU away from us,

1000 times the distance
of the Earth from the Sun.

And so even though it's probably larger

than the Earth, the amount
of light it reflects

from the Sun, the Sun is
just looks like a star

at that point, so far away from it,

that it barely reflects anything back.

It's extremely difficult to detect.

So there's all sorts of
wonders that may be lurking

out in the outer Solar System.

And so this has, leads
you to wonder, you know,

in the Oort cloud,

that Oort cloud must have
intermixed with other

Oort clouds in the past.

And so what fraction of
the Oort cloud is truly,

belongs to us, belongs
to the what was scattered

from Jupiter and Saturn.

What fraction of it could in
fact be interstellar visitors.

And of course we've got excited

about this recently because of ʻOumuamua,

this interstellar asteroid,
which seemed to be

at the time the first evidence
of an interstellar object.

But when you think about
the Oort cloud intermixing,

it may be that a large fraction of comets,

comets are seeded from the
Oort cloud that eventually

come in, some of those
comets may indeed have

been interstellar in the first place,

that we just didn't know about.

Through this process
there even is, an example,

I can't remember the name,

there's an example of a
comment that has a very

peculiar spectral signature
that has been hypothesized

to have actually been
an interstellar visitor,

but one that was essentially sourced

through this Oort cloud mixing.

And so this is kind of intriguing.

It also, you know, the Outer
Solar System is just such a,

it's like at the bottom of the ocean,

we know so little about
what's in the bottom

of our own planet's ocean.

And we know next to nothing

about what's in the outskirts
of our Solar System.

- It's all darkness.
- Yeah.

- So like, that's one of the things

is to understand the phenomena,

we need light and we need
to see how light interacts

with it or what light emanates from it.

But most of our universe is darkness.

So there could be a lot
of interesting stuff.

I mean this is where your interest is

with the cool worlds and
the interesting stuff lurks

in the darkness, right?

- Basically all of us, you
know, 400 years of astronomy,

our own window into the
universe has been light.

And that has only changed quite recently

with the discovery of gravitational waves.

That's now a new window.

And hopefully, well, to some
degree I guess solar neutrinos,

we've been detecting from it,

but they come from the Sun,
not interstellar space.

But we may be able to soon
detect neutrino messages.

There's even been hypothesized as a way

of communicating between
civilizations as well

or just do neutrino telescopes
to study the universe.

And so there's a growing
interest in what we'd call

multimessenger astronomy now.

So not just messages
from light but messages

from these other physical
packets of information

that are coming our way.

But when it comes to
the Outer Solar System,

light really is our only window.

There's two ways of doing that.

One is you detect the
light from the Oort cloud

object itself, which, as I just said,

is very, very difficult.

There's another trick which
we do in the Kuiper belt

especially, and that's
called an occultation.

And so sometimes those objects will

just pass in front of a distant
star, just coincidentally,

these are very, very brief moments.

They last for less than a second.

And so you have to have a very
fast camera to detect them.

Which conventionally
astronomers don't usually

build fast cameras.

Most of the phenomenon we
observe occurs on hours,

minutes, days even.

But now we're developing cameras
which can take, you know,

thousands of images per second,

and yet do it at the kind
of astronomical fidelity

that we need for this kind
of precise measurement.

And so you can see these very fast dips,

you even get these kind
of defraction patterns

that come around, which
are really cool to look at.

And that's, I kind of
love it 'cause it's almost

like passive radar.

You have these pinpricks of light,

imagine that you live
in a giant black sphere,

but there's these little
pinholes that have been poked

and through those pinholes
almost laser light

is shining through, and
inside this black sphere,

there are unknown things wandering around,

drifting around that we
are trying to discover.

And sometimes they will pass in front

of those little pencil thin laser beams,

block something out, and so we can tell

that it's there and it's
not an active radar,

'cause we didn't actually, you know,

beam anything out and
get a reflection off,

which is what the Sun does.

The Sun's like comes
off and it comes back.

That's more like an active radar system.

There's more like a passive
radar system where we are

just listening very intently.

And so I'm kind of so fascinated by that,

the idea that we could map
out the rich architecture

of the Outer Solar System
just by doing something

that we could have done
potentially for a long time.

Which is just listening in the right way,

just tuning our instrumentation
to the correct way

of not listening,

but viewing the universe
to catch those objects.

- Yeah, I mean it's really fascinating.

It's seems almost
obvious that your efforts

when projected out over
like 100, 200 years,

we will have a really good map

through even methods
basically transit timing,

high resolution transit timing,

but basically the
planetary and the planet's

satellite movements of
all the different star

systems out there.

- Yeah.

And it could revolutionize
the way we think

about the Solar System.

I mean that revolution
has happened several times

in the past, when we discovered
Vesta in the 19th century.

That was, I think,

the seventh planet for a
while or the eighth planet

when it was first discovered.

And then we discovered
Ceres and there was a bunch

of asteroid objects, Janus.

And so for a while the textbooks had,

there was something like 13 planets

in the Solar System,

and then that was just a
new capability that was

emerging to detect those small objects.

And then we ripped that up and said, no,

we're gonna change the
definition of a planet.

And then the same thing
happened when we started

looking the outer skirts
of the Solar System again,

we found Eris, we found
Sedna, these objects

which resembled Pluto.

And the more and more of
them we found Makemake.

And eventually we again
had to rethink the way

we even contextualize what a planet

is and what the nature of
the Outer Solar System is.

So regardless as to what
you think about the debate

about whether Pluto
should be demoted or not,

which I know often invokes
a lot of strong feelings,

it is an incredible
achievement that we were able

to transform our view of
the Solar System in a matter

of years just by, basically, you know,

charge coupled devices, the
things that's in cameras,

though the invention of
that device allowed us

to detect objects which
were much further away,

much fainter and revealed
all of this stuff that was

there all along.

And so that's the beauty of astronomy.

There's just so much to discover.

And even in our own backyard.

- Do you ever think about this?

Do you imagine, what
are the things that will

completely change astronomy
over the next 100 years?

Like if you transport
yourself forward 100 years,

what are the things
that will blow your mind

when you look at, wait, what?

Would it be just a very high
resolution mapping of things,

like, holy crap.

Like one surprising
thing might be holy crap,

there's like Earth-like moons everywhere.

Another one could be
just totally different

devices for sensing.

- Yeah, I think usually astronomy moves

forward dramatically,
and science in general,

when you have a new
technological capability come

online for the first time.

And we kind of just give examples

of that there with the Solar System.

So what kind of new
capabilities might emerge

in the next 100 years?

The capability I would love
to see is not just, I mean we,

in the next 10, 20 years,

we're hoping to take
these pale blue dot images

we spoke about.

So that requires building
something like JWST,

but on even larger scale and optimize

for direct imaging, we'd have to have

either coronagraph or a
star shade or something

to block out the starlight and
reveal those pale blue dots.

So in the next sort of decades,

I think that's the achievement
that we can look forward to

in our lifetimes is to see
photos of other earths.

Going beyond that, maybe in our lifetimes,

towards the end of our lifetimes, perhaps,

I'd love it if we,

I think it's technically possible

as Breakthrough Starshot giving us a lot

of encouragement with, to
maybe send a small probe

to the nearest stars and
to start actually taking

high resolution images of these objects.

There's only so much you
can do from far away.

If you wanna have, and we can
see it in the Solar System.

I mean there's only so much you can learn

about your Europa by pointing
Hubble Space Telescope at it.

But if you really wanna
understand that moon,

you're gonna have to send
something to orbit it,

to hopefully land on it and
drill down to the surface.

And so the idea of even
taking a flyby and doing

a snapshot photo that gets
beamed back that could be,

doesn't even have to be more
than 100 pixels by 100 pixels,

even that would be a completely

game-changing capability
to be able to truly

image these objects.

And maybe at home,

in our own Solar System,
we can certainly get

to a point where we produce
crude maps of exoplanets.

One of the, kind of the ultimate limit

of what a telescope could
do is governed by its size.

And so the largest telescope
you could probably ever build

would be one that was the size of the Sun.

There's a clever trick for doing

this without physically
building a telescope

that's the size of the Sun.

And that's to use the Sun
as a gravitational lens.

This was proposed I think by
Von Eshleman in like 1979.

But it builds upon Einstein's
theory of general relativity,

of course, that there
is a warping of light,

a bending of light from the
Sun's gravitational field.

And so a distant starlight,
it's like a magnifying glass.

Anything that bends light is basically,

can be used as a telescope.

It's gonna bend light to a point.

Now it turns out the Sun's
gravity is not strong enough

to create a, you know,

particularly great telescope
here because the focus

point is really out in the Kuiper belt.

It's a 550 astronomical
units away from the Earth.

So 550 times further away
from the Sun than we are.

And we've, you know,

that's beyond any of our
spacecraft have ever gone.

So you have to send a
spacecraft to that distance,

which would take 30, 40 years,

even optimistically improving

our chemical propulsion
systems significantly.

You'd have to bound it into that orbit,

but then you could use the
entire Sun as your telescope.

And with that kind of
capability you could image

planets to kilometer scale
resolution from afar.

And that really makes you wonder, I mean,

if we can conceive, maybe
we can't engineer it,

but if we can conceive of such a device,

what might other
civilizations be currently

observing about our own planet?

And perhaps that is why
nobody is visiting us

because there is so much
you can do from afar

that to them that's enough.

They, you know, maybe
they can get to the point

where they can detect our radio leakage,

they can drift our terrestrial, you know,

television signals, they
can map out our surfaces,

they can tell we have cities,

they can even do infrared
mapping of the heat

island effects and all this kind of stuff,

they can tell the chemical
composition of our planet.

And so that might be enough.

Maybe they don't need to
come down to the surface

and study, you know,

do anthropology and see what
our civilization is like.

But there's certainly a
huge amount you can do,

which is significantly
cheaper to some degree

than flying there, just
by exploiting cleverly

the physics of the universe itself.

- So your intuition is, and this

very well may be true
that observation might be

way easier than travel.

From our perspective,
from an alien perspective,

like we could get very
high resolution imaging

before we can ever get there.

- It depends on what information you want.

If you want to know the
chemical composition

and you want to know kilometer
scale maps of the planet,

then you could do that
from afar with some version

of these kind of gravitational lenses.

If you want to do better than that,

if you wanna image a
newspaper sat on the porch

of somebody's house, yeah,

you're gonna have to fly there.

There's no way, unless you had, you know,

a telescope the size of
Sagittarius A star or something,

you just simply cannot
collect enough light to do

that from many light years away.

So there is certainly reasons

why visiting will

always have its place
depending on what kind

of information you want.

We've proposed in my team
actually that the Sun

is the ultimate pinnacle
of telescope design,

but flying to 1000 AU is
a real pain in the butt

because it's just gonna take so long.

And so a more practical way
of achieving this might be

to use the Earth.

Now, the Earth doesn't
have anywhere near enough

gravity to create a
substantial gravitational lens,

but it has an atmosphere, and
an atmosphere refracts light,

it bends light.

So whenever you see a sunset,

just as the Sun's setting below horizon,

it's actually already beneath the horizon.

It's just the light is bending
through the atmosphere,

it's actually already about
half a degree down beneath.

And what you are seeing is that curvature

of the light path,

and your brain interprets
it of course to be following

a straight line because your
brain always thinks that.

And so you can use that bending,
whenever you have bending,

you have a telescope.

And so we've proposed in
my team that you could use

this refraction to similarly create

an Earth sized telescope...

- Called the Terrascope.
- The Terrascope. Yeah.

- You have a great video on this.

- Yeah. And there's-
- Do you have a paper

on the Terrascope?
- I do, yeah.

- Great.

- Sometimes get confused
this 'cause they've heard

of an Earth-sized telescope
'cause of the may have

heard of the Event Horizon
Telescope, which took

an image of the,

what's taken an image
right now of the center

of our black hole.

And this very impressive
and this previously did

Messier 87, a nearby
supermassive black hole.

And so those images were interferometrics,

so they were small
telescopes scattered across

the Earth and they
combined the light paths

together interferometricly
to create effectively

an Earth sized angular resolution.

Telescopes always have two properties.

There's the angular resolution,

which is how small of a thing
you can see on the surface,

and then there's the magnification,

how much brighter does
that object get versus

just your eye or some small object.

Now what the Event Horizon Telescope did,

it traded off amplification
or magnification

for the angular resolution.

That's what it wanted.

It wanted that high angular
resolution but doesn't

really have much photon collecting power,

because each telescope
individually is very small.

The Terrascope is different

because it is literally collecting light

with a light bucket which
is essentially the size

of the Earth.

And so that gives you
both benefits potentially,

not only the high angular
resolution that a large

aperture promises you but also actually

physically collects all those photons.

So you can detect light
from very, very far away,

the very outer edges of the universe.

And so we, yeah,

we propose this as a possible
future technological way

of achieving these extreme goals,

ambitious goals we have in astronomy.

But it's a very difficult system to test

because you essentially have to fly

out to these focus points
and these focus points

lie beyond the moon.

So you have to have someone
who is willing to fly

beyond the moon and
hitchhike an experimental

telescope onto it and do that cheaply.

If it was something doing in
low Earth orbit, it'd be easy.

You could just attach
a CubeSat to the next

Falcon 9 rocket or
something and test it out.

It'd probably only cost
you a few tens of thousands

of dollars, maybe $100,000 dollars.

But there's basically no one who flies

out that far except for bespoke missions,

such as like a mission that's
going to Mars or something,

that would pass through
that kind of space.

And they typically don't
have a lot of leeway

in excess payload that
they're willing to strap

on for radical experiments.

So that's been the problem with it.

In theory it should work beautifully,

but it's a very difficult
idea to experimentally test.

- Can you elaborate why the
focal point is that far away?

- So you get about half a degree bend

from the Earth's atmosphere
when you're looking

at the Sun at the horizon
and you get that two times

over if you are outside
of the planet's atmosphere

'cause it comes, you know,

the star is half a bend to
you on the horizon and half

a degree back out the other way.

So you get about a one degree bend,

you take the radius of the Earth,

which about 7,000 kilometers,

and do your arctan function,

you'll end up with a
distance that's about two,

it's actually, the inner focal point's

about two-thirds the distance
of the Earth-Moon system.

The problem with that inner focal point

is not useful because that light

ray path had to basically
scrape the surface of the Earth.

So it passes through the clouds,

it passes through all
the thick atmosphere,

it gets a lot of extinction along the way.

If you go higher up in altitude,
you get less extinction.

In fact you can even go above the clouds,

and so that's even better
'cause the clouds obviously

are gonna be a pain in the
neck doing anything optical.

But the problem with that
is that the atmosphere,

because it gets thinner
at higher altitude,

it bends light less.

And so that pushes the focal point out.

So the most useful focal
point is actually about three

or four times the distance
of the Earth-Moon separation.

And so that's what we call

one of the Lagrange points
essentially out there.

And so there was a stable orbit,

it's kind of the outmost
stable orbit you could

have around the Earth.

- So the atmosphere does bad
things to the signal of light?

- [David] Yeah, it's absorbing light.

- Is that possible to
reconstruct to remove the noise,

whatever, so it's just strength,
it's not, nothing else?

- It's possible to reconstruct, I mean,

to some degree we do this,

there's a technology
called adaptive optics

that can correct for what's
called wavefront errors

that happen through the Earth atmosphere.

The Earth's atmosphere is turbulent,

it is not a single plane
of air of the same density.

There's all kind of wiggles
and currents in the air.

And so that, each little
layer is bending light

in slightly different ways.

And so the light actually
kind of follows a wiggly path

on its way down.

What that means is that two light rays,

which are traveling at slightly different

spatial separations from
each other will arrive

at the detector at different
times because one maybe

goes on more or less a
straight path and the other one

wiggles down a bit more before it arrives.

And so you have an
incoherent light source.

And when you're trying to
do image reconstruction,

you always want a coherent light source.

So the way they correct
for this is that this,

if this path had to travel
a little bit faster,

the straight one goes
faster and the wiggly one

takes longer, the mirror is deformable

and so you actually
bend the mirror on this,

on the straight one down
a little bit to make

it an equivalent light path distance.

So the mirror itself has
all these little actuators

and it's actually made
up of like thousands

of little elements, almost
looks like a liquid mirror,

'cause they can manipulate
it in kind of real time.

And so they scan the
atmosphere with a laser beam

to tell what the defamations
are in the atmosphere

and then make the
corrections to the mirror

to account for it.

- That's amazing.
- So you could,

you could do something like this

for the Terrascope, but it would be-

- It's cheaper and easier
to go above the atmosphere

and just fly out.

- I think so.

- That's a very challenging thing to do.

And normally when you do
adaptive optics, as it's called,

you're looking straight up.

So you are, you know, or we're
very close to straight up.

If you look at the horizon,

we basically never do
astronomical observations

on the horizon 'cause you're looking

through more atmosphere.

The, if you go straight up you're looking

at the thinnest portion
atmosphere possible.

But as you go closer and
close towards the horizon,

you'll increase in what
we call the air mass,

the amount of air you
have to travel through.

So here it's kind of the worst case 'cause

you're going through the entire atmosphere

in and out again with the Terrascope.

So you'd need a very impressive
adaptive optic system

to correct for that.

So yeah, I would say
it's probably simpler,

at least for a proof of principle,

just to test it with having
some satellite that was

at a much wider orbit.

- Now, speaking of traveling
out into deep space, yeah,

you already mentioned this a little bit,

you made a beautiful video called

"The Journey to the End of the Universe."

And sort of at the start
of that you're talking

about Alpha Centauri.

So what would it take for humans

or for human-like creatures to travel

out to Alpha Centauri?

- There's a few different
ways of doing it, I suppose.

One is it depends on
how fast your ship is.

That's always gonna be
the determining factor.

If we devised some
interstellar propulsion system

that could travel a fraction
at the speed of light,

then we could do it in our lifetimes,

which is I think what
people normally dream

of when they think about
interstellar, you know,

propulsion and travel, that
you could literally step

onto the spacecraft, maybe
a few years later you step

off an Alpha Centauri B,
you walk around the surface

and come back and visit your family.

There would be of course
a lot of relativistic

time dilation as a result of that trip.

You would've aged a lot
less than people back

on Earth by traveling
close to the speed of light

for some fraction of time.

The challenge of this of
course is that we haven't no

such propulsion system
that can achieve this.

So...

- But you think it's possible like,

so you have a paper

called The Halo Drive: Fuel-Free
Relativistic Propulsion

of Large Masses via
Recycled Boomerang Photons.

So do you think, first
of all, what is that?

And second of all,

how difficult are alternate
propulsion systems?

- Yeah, so before I
took in the halo drive,

there was an idea,

'cause I think the halo drive is not gonna

solve this problem.

I'll talk about the
halo drive in a moment.

But the halo drive is
useful for a civilization

which is a bit more
advanced than us that has

spread across the stars
and is looking for a cheap

highway system to get across the galaxy.

For that first step...

Just to context that,

the halo driver requires a black hole,

so that's why you're
not gonna be able to do

this on the Earth right now.

But there are lots of black
holes in the Milky Way.

That's the good news. So we'll
come to that in a moment.

But if you're trying to travel

to Alpha Centauri without a
black hole, then the most,

you know, there were some ideas out there,

there was a Project
Daedalus and Project Icarus

that were two projects

that the British Interplanetary
Society conjured up

on sort of a 20, 30 year time scale.

And they asked themselves
if we took existing

and speculatively, but realistic attempts

at future technology that
are emerging over the next

few decades, how far

could we push interstellar travel system?

And they settled on fusion drives in that.

So if we had the ability to
essentially either detonate,

you can also imagine that
kind of nuclear fission

or nuclear fusion bombs going off behind

the spacecraft and propelling
it that way or having

some kind of successful
nuclear fusion reaction,

which obviously we haven't
really demonstrated

yet as a propulsion system,

then you could achieve
something like 10% the speed

of light in those systems.

But these are huge spacecrafts
and I think you need

a huge spacecraft if you're
gonna take people along.

The conversation recently
has actually switched,

and that idea is kind
of seems a little bit

antiquated now and most of
us have kind of given up

in the idea of people physically,

biologically stepping
on board the spacecraft.

And maybe we'll be sending
something that's more like

a microprobe that maybe
just weighs a gram or two.

And that's much easier to accelerate.

You could push that with a
laser system to very high speed,

get it to maybe 20% of the speed of light.

It has to survive the journey.

Probably a large fraction
of them won't survive

the journey, but they're
cheap enough that you could

maybe manufacture millions
of them and some of them

do arrive and able to send
back an image or maybe even,

if you wanted to have a person there,

we might have some way of
doing like a telepresence

or some kind of delayed
telepresence or some kind

of reconstruction of the
planet which is sent back.

So you can digitally interact
with that environment

in a way which is not real time,

but representative of what
that planet would be like

to be on the surface.

So we might be more like digital
visitors to these planets,

certainly far easier practically to do

that than physically forcing
this wet chunk of meat

to fly light years
across space to do that.

And so that's maybe
something we can imagine

down the road.

The halo drive, as I said, is
thinking even further ahead.

And if you did want to launch,

large masses, large masses could
even be planet size things,

in the case of the halo drive,
you can use black holes.

So this is kind of a trick of physics.

You know, I often think
of the universe as like

a big computer game and you're
trying to find cheat codes,

hacks, exploits that the
universe didn't intend

for you to use, but once you find them,

you can address all sorts
of interesting capabilities

that you didn't previously have.

And the halo drive does
that with black holes.

So if you have two black holes,

which are very common
situation, a binary black hole,

and they've been spiraling
towards each other,

LIGO has detected, I think,
dozens of these things,

maybe even over 100 at this point.

And these things, as they
merge together, they,

the pre-merger phase, they're
orbiting each other very,

very fast, even close
to the speed of light.

And so Freeman Dyson,
before he passed away,

I think in the '70s, he
had this provocative paper

called Gravitational Machines.

And he suggested that you
could use neutron stars

as an interstellar propulsion system.

And neutron stars are
sort of the, you know,

the lower mass version

of a binary black hole
system, essentially.

In this case he suggested just doing

gravitational slingshot,
just fly your spacecraft

into this very compact

and relativistic binary system,

and you do need neutron stars,

because if they were two stars,

they'd be physically touching each other.

So the neutron stars are so small,

like 10 kilometers across,

they can get really close
to each other and have

these very, very fast orbits
with respect to each other.

You shoot your spacecraft through,

right through the middle,

like throwing through the
eye of a needle and you do

a slingshot around one of
them and you do it around

the one that's coming sort of towards you.

So one of 'em would be coming away,

one would be coming towards
you at any one point.

And then you could basically steal some

of the kinetic energy in the slingshot.

In principle, you can set
up to twice the speed,

you can take your speed
and it becomes your speed

plus twice the speed

of the neutron star in this case.

And that would be your new
speed after the slingshot.

This seems great because it's
just free energy basically.

You're not doing any, you
know, you're not generating,

you don't have a nuclear power reactor

or anything to generate this.

You're just stealing it.

And indeed you could get to
relativistic speeds this way.

So I loved that paper,
but I had a criticism,

and the criticism was that
this is like trying to fly

your ship into a blender, right?

This is two neutron stars,

which have huge tidal
forces and they're whipping

around each other once
every second or even less

than a second, and you're
trying to fly your spaceship

and do this maneuver that
is pretty precarious.

And so it just didn't seem practical to me

to do this, right?

I loved it.

And so I took that idea
and this is how science is,

it's iterative, you take
a previous great man's

idea and you just sort
of maybe slightly tweak

it and improve it.

And that's how I see the halo drive.

And I just suggested,

why not replace those out for black holes,

which is certainly very common.

And rather than flying your
ship into that hell hole

of a blender system,

you just stand back and
you fire a laser beam.

Now, because black holes have such intense

gravitational fields, they can bend light

into complete 180s, they
can actually become mirrors.

So, you know, the Sun bends
light by maybe a fraction

of a degree through gravitational
lensing, but, you know,

a compact object like a
black hole can do a full 180.

In fact, if you, obviously,
if you went too close,

if you put the laser beam too close

to the black hole, it would
just fall into it and never

come back out.

So you just kind of push it
out, push it out, push it out,

until you get to a point
where it's just skirting

the event horizon and then
that laser beam skirts

around and it comes back.

Now the laser beam wants to do a,

I mean it is doing a gravitational
slingshot, but laser,

I mean, light, photons
can't speed up unlike

the spaceship case.

So instead of speeding up,

the way they steal energy is they increase

their frequency so they become
higher energy photon packets,

essentially, they get blue shifted,

so that you send maybe a
red laser beam that comes

back blue, it's got more energy in it.

And because photons carry momentum,

which is somewhat unintuitive
in every day experience,

but they do, that's how solar sails work,

they carry momentum, they push things,

you can even use them as
laser tweezers and things

to pick things up, because they push,

it comes back with more
momentum than it left.

So you get an acceleration,
force from this, and again,

you're just seeing energy from
the black hole to do this,

so you can get up to the same speed,

it's basically the same idea

as Freeman Dyson, but doing
it from a safer distance,

and there should be an order
of, you know, a million or so,

or 10 million black holes
in the Milky Way galaxy.

Some of them would be even
as close as sort of 10

to 20 light years,

when you do the occurrence rate statistics

of how close you might
expect feasibly one to be,

they're of course difficult to detect

because they're black
and so they're inherently

hard to see.

But statistically there should be plenty

out there in the Milky Way.

And so these objects would
be natural waypoint stations,

you could use them to both accelerate away

and to brake and slow down.

- And on top of all this, you know,

we've been talking about
astronomy and cosmology.

There's been a lot of
exciting breakthroughs

in detection and
exploration of black holes.

So the boomeranging photons
that you're talking about,

there's been a lot of work on photon rings

and just all the fun
stuff going on outside

the black holes.
- Yeah.

- So all the garbage
outside is actually might be

the thing that holds
a key to understanding

what's going on inside.

And there's the Hawking radiation.

There's all kinds of fascinating stuff.

Like, I mean there there's
trippy stuff about black holes

that I can't even, well,
most people don't understand.

I mean, the holographic
principle with the plate

and the information being
stored potentially outside

of the black hole, I don't even,

I can't even comprehend
how you can project

a three-dimensional object
onto a 2D and somehow

store information where
it doesn't destroy it

challenging all of physics,

all of this is very interesting,

especially for kind of
more practical applications

of how the black hole could
be used for propulsion.

- Yeah, I mean,

it may be that black holes
are used in all sorts

of ways by advanced civilizations.

I think, again, it's been a popular idea

in science fiction or
science fiction trope

that Sagittarius A star,

the super massive black hole in the center

of our galaxy could be
the best place to look

for intelligent life in the universe

because it is a giant
engine, in a way, you know,

a unique capability of
a black hole as you can

basically throw matter
into it and you can get

these jets that come out,

the accretion disks and
the jets that fly out.

And so you can more or
less use them to convert

matter into energy via
e equals mc squared.

And there's pretty much
nothing else, except for,

you know, annihilation

with its own antiparticle
as a way of doing that.

So they have some unique properties,

you could perhaps power civilization

by just throwing garbage
into a black hole, right?

Just throwing asteroids in and power

your civilization with as
much energy as you really

would ever plausibly need.

And you could also use
them to accelerate your way

across the universe.

And you can even imagine
using small artificial

black holes as thermal generators, right?

So the Hawking radiation from them kind

of exponentially increases
as they get smaller

and smaller in size.

And so a very small black hole,

one that you could almost
imagine like holding

in your hand, would be a
fairly significant heat source.

And so that raises all sorts of prospects

about how you might use that
in an engineering context

to power your civilization as well.

- You have a video of becoming a Kardashev

type I civilization.

What's our hope for doing
that or a few orders

of magnitude away from that?

- Yeah, it is surprising, I think,

people tend to think that
we're close to this scale.

The Kardashev type I is
defined as a civilization

which is using as much
energy as is essentially

existing upon the planet from the star.

So that's of water, I think, for the Earth

of something like 10 to the 5 Twh

or 10 to the seven TWh
is a gigantic amount

of energy and we're using a tiny, tiny,

tiny fraction of that right now.

So, you know, if you became a
Kardashev type I civilization,

which is seen not necessarily

as a goal into itself, I
think people think, well,

why are we aspiring to become

this energy hungry civilization?

You know, surely our energy
needs might become, you know,

might improve our efficiency
or something as time goes on.

But ultimately the more
energy you have access to,

the greater your capabilities will be.

I mean, if you wanna lift
Mount Everest into space,

there is just a calculable
amount of potential

energy change that that's
going to take in order

to accomplish that.

And the more energy you have
access to as a civilization,

then clearly the easier
that energy achievement

is going to be.

So, depends on what your
aspirations are as a civilization.

It might not be something
you wanna ever do, but...

- Well, but we should
make clear that lifting

heavy things isn't the only thing.

It's just doing work.

So yeah, it could be
computation, it could be...

- Right, right.
- It could be

more and more and more

and more sophisticated
and larger and larger

and larger computation, which is,

it does seem where we're
headed with the very

fast increase in

the scale and the quality

of our computation,
outside the human brain.

Artificial computation.

- Yeah, I mean computation is
a great example of, I mean,

already I think something
like 10% of US power

electricity use is going

towards these super computing centers.

So there's a vast amount of current energy

which are already going towards computing.

We surely only increase over time.

If we start ever doing
anything like mind uploading

or creating simulated realities,

that cost will surely become
almost a dominant source

of our engine requirements at that point

if civilization completely
moves over to this kind

of posthumanism stage.

And so it's not unreasonable
that our energy needs

would continue to grow.

Certainly historically,

they always have at about 2% per year.

And so if that continues,

there is gonna be a certain
point where you're running

up against the amount
of energy which you can

harvest 'cause it's, you are using,

even if you cover the entire
planet in solar panels,

there's no more energy to be had.

And so this is a, you know,

there's a few ways of achieving this.

I sort of talked about in
the video how there were

several renewable energy
sources that we're excited

about like geothermal, wind power, waves.

But pretty much all of
those don't really scratch

the surface or don't really
scratch the itch of going

to a Kardashev type I civilization,
they're meaningful now,

I would never tell anybody
don't do wind power now

because it's clearly useful
for our current stage

of civilization, but it's not,

it's gonna be a pretty negligible fraction

of our energy requirements if we got

to that stage of development.

And so there has to be a breakthrough

in either our ability
to harvest solar energy,

which would require maybe
something like a space array

of solar panels beaming
the energy back down,

or some developments and innovations

in nuclear fusion that would allow us

to essentially reproduce the same process

of what's producing the solar
photons, but here on Earth.

But even that comes
with some consequences.

If you're generating the energy here

on Earth and you're doing
work on it on Earth, then

that work is gonna produce
waste heat and that waste

heat is gonna increase
the ambient temperature

of the planet.

And so even if this isn't
really a greenhouse effect,

that you're increasing the
temperature of the planet,

this is just the amount of
computers that are churning.

You put your hand to a computer,

you can feel the warmth coming off them.

If you do that much work
of literally the, you know,

the entire instant energy
of the planet is doing

that work, the planet's
gonna warm up significantly

as a result of that.

And so, you know,

that clearly indicates that
this is not a sustainable path,

that civilizations as they
approach Kardashev type I

are gonna have to leave planet Earth,

which is really the point of that video,

to show that it's, a
Kardashev type I civilization,

even though it's defined as
instant energy upon a planet,

that is not a species that
is gonna still be living

on their planet, at least in isolation,

they will have to be
harvesting energy from afar,

they will have to be doing
work on that energy outside

of their planet because otherwise

you're gonna dramatically
change the environment

in which you live.

- Well, yeah, so the, that's
the more energy you create,

the more energy you use,

the higher the imperative to
expand out into the universe,

but also not just the
imperative, but the capabilities.

And you've kind of as
aside on your lab page

mentioned that you're sometimes

interested in astroengineering.

So what kind of space
architectures do you think

we can build to house
humans or interesting things

outside of Earth?

- Yeah, I mean there's
a lot of fun ideas here.

One of the classic ideas
is an O'Neill cylinder

or a Stanford torus.

These are like two rotating
structures that were

devised in space, they're basically using

the centrifugal force
as artificial gravity.

And so these are
structures which tend to be

many kilometers across that
you're building in space,

but could potentially
habitat millions of people

in orbit of the Earth.

Of course you could
imagine pulling them if,

you know, "The Expanse" does
a pretty good job, I think,

of exploring the idea of human

exploration of the Solar
System and having many objects,

many of the small near Earth objects

and asteroids inhabited
by mining colonies.

One of the ideas we've
played around with our group

is this technology called a quasite.

A quasite is an extension.

Again, we always tend to
extend previous ideas,

ideas build upon ideas,

but an extension idea called a statite,

a statite was an idea

proposed I think by Ron
Forward in the 1970s.

1970s seemed to have all
sorts of wacky ideas.

I dunno what was going on then.

We had I think the Stanford torus,

he O'Neill cylinder, statites,
the gravitational lens.

People were really having
fun with dreaming about space

in the '70s.

The statite is basically a solar sail,

but it's such an efficient solar sail

that the outward force of
radiation pressure equals

the inward force of gravity from the Sun.

And so it doesn't need to orbit.

Normally you avoid, the
Sun is pulling us right

now through a force of gravity,

but we are not getting closer

towards the Sun, even
though we are falling

towards the Sun because we're in orbit,

which means our translational
speed is just enough

to keep us at the same altitude
essentially from the Sun.

And so you're in orbit

and that's how you maintain distance.

A statite doesn't need to do that.

It could be basically, you know,

completely static in inertial space,

but it's just balancing the two forces

of radiation pressure and
inward gravitational pressure.

A quasite is the in-between
of those two states.

So it has some significant
outward pressure

but not enough to resist
fully falling into the star.

And so it compensates for that by having

some translational motion.

So it's in between an orbit and a statite.

And so what that allows you to do

is maintain artificial orbits.

So normally, you know,

if you wanna calculate your orbital speed

of something that's say
half an AU, you would use

Kepler's third law and go
through that and you'd say, okay,

you know, if it's that
half an AU, I can calculate

the period by Pi squared
proportional to A cubed

and go through that.

But for a quasite,

you can basically have any speed you want.

It's just a matter of

how much of the gravitational
force are you balancing out.

You effectively enter an
orbit where you are making

the mass of the star be less
massive than it really is.

So it's as if you are
orbiting a 0.1 solar mass star

or a 0.2 solar mass
star, whatever you want.

And so that means that
Mercury orbits with a pretty

fast gravitational, a pretty
fast orbital speed around

the Sun because it's closer
to the Sun than we are.

But we could put something
in Mercury's orbit

that would have a slower
speed and so it would

co-track with the Earth.

And so we would always be
aligned with them at all times.

And so this could be useful
if you wanted to have a,

either a chain of colonies or something,

that were able to easily communicate

and move between one another,

between these different bases.

You'd probably use something
like this to maintain

that easy transferability.

Or you could even use
it as a space weather

monitoring system, which we
actually proposed in the paper.

We know that major events like

the Carrington Event
that happen, you know,

it can knock out

all of our electromagnetic
systems quite easily.

A major solar flare could do
that, a geomagnetic storm.

But if we had the ability
to detect those higher

elevated activity cycles in advance,

the problem is they travel
obviously pretty fast

and so it's hard to get ahead of them.

But you could have a
station which is basically

sampling solar flares
very close to the surface

to the Earth, and as soon as it detects

anything suspicious,
magnetically, it could then send

that information straight
back at the speed light

to your Earth and give you
maybe half an hour warning

or something, that something, you know,

something bad was coming
and you should shut off all

your systems or get in
your Faraday cage now

and protect yourself.

And so these quasites are kind
of a cool trick of, again,

kind of hacking the laws of physics.

It's like another one of these exploits

that the universe seems to allow us to do

to potentially manifest
these artificial systems

that would otherwise be
difficult to produce.

- So leveraging natural phenomena.

- Yeah. That's always
the key is to work...

In my mind, is to work with nature,

that's how I see astroengineering,
rather than against it.

You're not trying to
force it to do something.

You know, that's why I
always think solar energy

is so powerful because
in the battle against

nuclear fusion, nuclear
fusion you're really fighting

a battle where you're
trying to confine plasma

into this extremely tight space or it's,

the Sun does this for
free, it has gravitation.

And so that's in essence
what a solar panel does.

It is a nuclear fusion reactive fueled

energy system, but it's
just using gravitation

for the confinement and
having a huge standoff

distance for its energy collection.

And so there are tricks like
that, it's a very naive,

simple trick in that case, where we can,

rather than having to reinvent the wheel,

we can use the space
infrastructure, if you like,

the astrophysical
infrastructure that's already

there to our benefit.

- Yeah, I think in the
long arc of human history,

probably natural phenomena
is the right solution.

That's the simple, that's
the elegant solution

'cause all the power's already there.

That's why Dyson sphere
and the long, sort of,

but you don't know what a
Dyson sphere would look like,

but some kind of thing
that leverages the power,

the energy that's already
in the Sun is better

than creating artificial
nuclear fusion reaction.

But then again, that brings
us to the topic of AI.

How much of this, if
we're traveling out there,

intracellular travel or doing some

of the interesting things
we've be talking about,

how much of those ships would
be occupied by AI systems,

do you think?

What would be the living
organisms occupying those ships?

- Yeah, it's depressing to think

about AI in the search
for life because it has,

I mean I've been thinking
about it a lot over the last

few weeks with playing around
with ChatGPT3, like many

of us, and being astonished
with its capabilities.

And you see that our society
is undergoing a change

that seems significant in
terms of the development

of artificial intelligence.

We've been promised this
revolutionist singularity

for a long time, but it
really seems to be stepping up

its pace of development at this point.

And so that's interesting,

because as someone who
looks freely in life

out there in the universe,

it sort of implies that our current stage

of development is highly transitional.

And that, you know,

you go back for the last 4
and a half billion years,

the planet was done, essentially,

if you go back last few thousand years,

there was a civilization,

but it wasn't really producing
any technosignatures.

And then over the last maybe 100 years,

there's been something that
might be detectable from afar,

but we're approaching this cusp

where we might imagine it.

I mean we are thinking of like maybe years

and decades with AI development typically

when we talk about this.

But as an astronomer,

I have to think about much
longer time scales of centuries,

millennia, millions of years.

And so if this wave continues
over that timescale,

which is still the blink of
an eye on a cosmic timescale,

that implies that everything
will be AI essentially

out there, if this is a common behavior.

And so that's intriguing
because it sort of implies

that we are special in
terms of our moment in time

as a civilization, which
it normally is something

we are averse to as astronomers.

We normally like this
mediocrity principle.

We are not special, we're a
typical part of the universe,

the cosmological principle.

But in a temporal sense we
may be in a unique location.

And perhaps that is part of the solution

to the Fermi paradox, in fact,

that if it is true that planets tend to go

through basically three phases,

dumb life for the vast majority,

a brief period of biological
intelligence and then

an extended period of
artificial intelligence

that they transition to,

then we would be in a
unique and special moment

in galactic history that
would be a particular

interest for any anthropologist

out there in the galaxy, right?

This would be the time that
you would want to study

a civilization very carefully.

You wouldn't want to interfere with it,

you would just wanna see how it plays out.

Kind of similar to the ancestor simulation

that are sometimes talked up
with the simulation argument,

that you are able to observe
perhaps your own origins

and study how the transformation happens.

And so, yeah, that has for
me recently been destroying

the Fermi paradox a bit
on its head and this idea

of the zoo hypothesis,
that we may be monitored,

which has for a long
time been sort of seen

as a fringe idea even
amongst the SETI community.

But if we live in this
truly transitional period,

it adds a lot of impetus
to that idea, I think.

- Well, even AI itself
would, by its very nature,

would be observing us by,
you know, it's like human,

there used to be this
concept of human computation,

which is actually exactly
what's feeding the current

chat language models,
which is leveraging all

the busy stuff we're doing to
do the hard work of learning.

So like the language models are trained

on human interaction and human
language, on the internet.

And so it would, AI feeds on the output

of brain power from humans.

And so like, it would be observing,

observing and it gets
stronger as it observes.

So it actually gets extremely
good at observing humans.

And one of the interesting
philosophical questions

that starts percolating is

what is the interesting
thing that makes us human?

We tend to think of it,

and you said like there's three phases,

what's the thing that's hard
to come by in phase three?

Is it something like scarcity,
which is limited resources?

Is it something like consciousness?

Is that the thing

that emerged the evolutionary process

in biological systems

that are operating under
constrained resources,

this thing that feels,

that it feels like something
to experience the world,

which we think of as consciousness,

is that really difficult to replicate

in artificial systems?

Is that the thing that makes
us fundamentally human?

Or is it just a side effect
that we attribute way too

much importance to?

Do you have a sense,

if you look out into the
future and AI systems are

the ones that are traveling

out there to Alpha Centauri and beyond,

do you think they have to carry the flame

of consciousness with them?

- No, not necessarily.

They may do, but it may
not be a necessarily...

I mean I guess we were talking
about the difference here

between sort of an AGI,
artificial general intelligence

or consciousness, which
are distinct ideas.

And you can certainly have
one without the other.

So I couldn't imagine-
- I would disagree

with this certainly in that statement.

- [David] Okay. Okay.

- I think it's very possible
in order to have intelligence,

you have to have consciousness.

- Okay.

Well, I mean to a certain
degree ChatGPT3 has a level

of intelligence already.

It's not a general intelligence,

but it displays properties of intelligence

with no consciousness.

So...

- Again, I would disagree.
- Okay. Okay.

Well, I don't know, I-
- Because you said that,

it is very nice that you said

it displays properties of intelligence.

In the same way, displays
properties of intelligence,

I would say it's starting to display

properties of consciousness.

It certainly could fool
you that it's conscious.

- Correct. Yeah.

So there's, I guess like
a Turing test problem,

like if it's displaying
one of those properties,

if it quacks like a duck,

isn't it basically a duck at that point?

So yeah, I can see that argument.

It probably, I mean,

certainly is interesting to think

about it from the observers
point of view as an astronomer,

what am I looking for?

Whether that intelligence
is conscious or not has

little bearing, I think,

as to what I should be
looking for when I'm trying

to detect evidence of them.

It would maybe affect
their behavior in ways

that I can't predict.

But that's, again, getting into the game

of what I would call
xenopsychology of trying

to make projections about the motivations

of an alien species is
incredibly difficult.

And similarly, for any kind
of artificial intelligence,

it's unfathomable what
its intentions may be.

I mean, I would sort of
question whether it would

even be interested in traveling
between the stars at all.

If its primary goal is computation,

computation for the sake of computation,

then it's probably gonna
have a different way of,

and you know, it's gonna
be engineering its solar

system and the nearby material around

it for a different goal,

if it's just simply trying
to increase computer

substrate across the universe.

And that of course,

if that is its principle intention

to just essentially convert
dumb matter into smart

matter as it goes,

then I think that would come into conflict

with our observations
of the universe, right?

Because the Earth shouldn't
be here if that were true,

the Earth should have been transformed

into computer substrate by this point.

There has been plenty
of time in the history

of the galaxy for that to have happened.

So I'm skeptical that we can...

I'm skeptical in the part
that that's a behavior

that AI or any civilization
really engages in.

But I also find it difficult
to find a way out of it.

To explain why that would never happen

in the entire history of the
galaxy amongst potentially,

if life is common, millions,

maybe even billions of
instantiations of AI could

have occurred across the galaxy.

And so that seems to be
a knock against the idea

that there is life or
intelligent life elsewhere

in the galaxy.

The fact that hasn't occurred
in our history is maybe

the only solid data point we really have

about the activities of the civilizations.

- Of course, the scary
one could be that we just,

at this stage, intelligent
alien civilizations

just start destroying themselves,

because it becomes too powerful.

Everything's just, too many weapons,

too many nuclear weapons,

too many nuclear weapon style systems

that just from mistake to aggression to...

Like the probability of
self-destruction is too

high relative to the
challenge of avoiding,

the technological challenges
of avoiding self-destruction.

- You mean the AI destroys itself or...

We destroy ourselves
prior to the advent of AI.

- As we get smarter and smarter
AI, either AI destroys us

or other, there could be just a million...

Like AI is correlated,

the development of AI
is correlated with all

this other technological
innovation, genetic engineering,

like all kinds of engineering
at the nano-scale,

mass manufacturing of
things that could destroy us

or cracking physics enough to
have very powerful weapons,

nuclear weapons, all of it.

Just too much physics
enables way too many things

that can destroy us before it enables

the propulsion systems
that allow us to fly far

enough away before we destroy ourselves.

- Hmm.
- So maybe that's what happens

to the other alien civilization.

- Is that your resolution?

'Cause I mean I think us in
the technosignature community,

in the astronomical
community aren't thinking

about this problem seriously
enough, in my opinion.

We should be thinking about the,

what AI is doing to our
society and the implications

what we are looking for.

And so the only I think
part of this thinking has

to involve people like
yourself who are more intimate

with the machine learning and artificial

intelligence world, is
your, how do you reconcile,

in your mind, you said
earlier that you think

you can't imagine a galaxy
where life and intelligence

is not all over the place,

and if artificial
intelligence is a natural

progression for civilizations,
how do you reconcile

that with, with the absence
of any information around us?

So any clues or hints
of artificial behavior,

artificially engineered
stars or colonization,

computer substrate, transformed
planets, anything like that?

- It's extremely difficult for me.

The Fermi paradox broadly defined

is extremely difficult for me.

And the terrifying thing is,

one thing I suspect is that
we keep destroying ourselves.

The probability of self-destruction

with advanced technology
is just extremely high.

That's why we're not seeing it.

But then again, my intuition
of about why we haven't

blown ourselves up with nuclear weapons,

it's very surprising to me
from a scientific perspective.

It doesn't, given all the
cruelty I've seen in the world,

given the power that
nuclear weapons placed

in the hands of very small
number of individuals,

it's very surprising to me we
haven't destroyed ourselves,

and it seems to be a very
low probability situation

we have happening here.

But, and then the other
explanation is the zoos,

the observation, that
we're just being observed.

That's the only other thing.

It's just, it's so difficult for me...

Of course, all of science,
everything is very humbling.

It would be very humbling for me to learn

that we're alone in the universe.

It would change, you know
what, maybe I do want

that to be true 'cause
you want us to be special.

That's why I'm resisting
that thought, maybe.

There's no way we're that special.

There's no way we're that special.

That's where my resistance comes from.

- I would just say, you know,

the specialness is something we,

implicitly in that statement,

there's kind of an assumption that we are

something positive,

like we're a gift to
this planet or something.

And that makes us special.

But you know, it may be that
intelligence is more of an,

is like we're like rats or cockroaches,

we're an infestation of this planet.

We're not some benevolent
property that the planet would,

a planet would ideally like to have,

if you can even say such a thing.

But we may be not only
generally a negative force

for a planet's biosphere
and its own survivability,

which I think you can make
a strong argument about,

but we may also be a very
persistent infestation that may,

even in, you know,
interesting thoughts in this,

in the wake of a nuclear war,

would that be an absolute
eradication of every human being,

which would be a fairly extreme event?

Or would the kind of like consciousness,

as you might call it, the
flame of consciousness,

continue with some small pockets

that would maybe in 10,000 years,

100,000 years, we'd see
civilization reemerge

and play out the same thing over again.

- Yeah.

That's certainly, the
nuclear weapons aren't

powerful enough yet, but yes,

but to sort of push back
on the infestation, sure.

But the word special
doesn't have to be positive.

I just mean...

- I think it tends to imply,
but I take your point. Yeah.

But maybe, just maybe extremely
rare might be... Yeah.

- Yeah.

And that to me, it just,

it is very strange for me
to be cosmically unique.

It's just very strange.

I mean, that we're the
only thing of this level

of complexity in the galaxy?

Just seems very strange
to me, that would...

- I would just, yeah,

I do think it depends
on this classification,

there is sort of an, again,

it's kind of buried
within there as a subtext,

but there is a classification
that we're doing here

that what we are is a distinct
category of life, let's say,

in this case, when we're
talking about intelligence,

we are something that can be separated.

But of course we see intelligence across

the animal kingdom in, you
know, dolphins, humpback whales,

octopuses, crows, ravens.

And so it's quite possible that these are

all manifestations of this same thing.

And we are not a particularly
distinct class except

for the fact we make
technology that's really

any difference, our intelligence.

And we classify that separately.

But from a biological
perspective, to some degree,

it's really just all part of a continuum.

And so that's why I, when
we talk about unique,

you are putting yourself
in a box which is distinct

and saying this is the
only example of things

that fall into this box.

But the walls of that box
may themselves be a construct

of our own arrogance that
we are something distinct.

- And, but I was also
speaking broadly, for us,

meaning all life on Earth,

but then it's possible
that there's all kinds

of living ecosystems on
other planets and other moons

that just don't have interest
in technological development.

And maybe technological
development is the parasitic

thing that destroys the organism, broadly.

And then maybe that's actually one

of the fundamental realities,

whatever broad way to categorize
technological development,

that's just a parasitic thing
that just destroys ourself.

- Yeah.
- It's a cancer, you know.

- We're flirting around,
sorry to interrupt,

but we're flirting around
this idea of the great filter

a little bit here.

So we asking where is this,
does it lie ahead of us,

nuclear war, maybe imminent,

that would be a filter that's ahead of us,

or could it be behind us?

And that it's the advent of
technology that is genuinely

a rare occurrence in the
universe and that explains

the Fermi paradox.

And so that's something
that obviously people have

debated and argued about in
SETI for decades and decades.

But it remains a persistent,

people argue whether it
should be really called

a paradox or not, but
it remains a consistent,

apparent contradiction
that you can make a very

cogent argument as to why you expect life

and intelligence to be
common in the universe.

And yet everything, everything we know

about the universe is fully compatible

with just us being here.

And that's a haunting thought.

But I'm not, I have no
preference or desire

for that to be true.

I'm not trying to impose
that view on anyone.

But I do ask that we remain
open-minded until evidence

has been collected either way.

- Well, the thing is,
it's one of, if not the,

probably I would argue,

is the most important question
facing human civilization,

or the most interesting.

I think, scientifically speaking,

like what question is more important?

Than, somehow, you know,

there could be other ways to
sneak up to it, but it gets

to the essence of what we are?

- [David] Yes.

- What these living organisms are.

If somehow seeing another kind-

- Yeah.
- Helps us understand.

- It speaks to the human condition,

helps us understand what it is
to be human, to some degree.

I think, you know, I have tried to

remain very agnostic about the idea

of life and intelligence.

One thing I try to be
more optimistic about,

and I've been thinking a lot
with our searches for life

in the universe is life in the past.

I think it's actually
not that hard to imagine

we are the only civilization
in the galaxy right now.

- Living?
- Yeah.

That's currently extant.

But there may be very many
extinct civilizations.

If each civilization has a
typical lifetime comparable to,

let's say, AI is the demise of our own.

That's only a few hundred years

of technological development
or maybe 10,000 years

if you go back to the
neolithic revolution,

the dawn of agriculture, you know,

hardly anything in a cosmic time span.

That's nothing. That's
the blink of an eye.

And so it's not surprising
at all that we would happen

not to coexist with anyone else,

but that doesn't mean
nobody else was ever here.

And if other civilizations
come to that same

conclusion and realization,
maybe they scour

or the galaxy around them,

don't find any evidence for intelligence,

then they have two options.

They can either give up on
communication and just say,

well, it's never gonna happen.

We just may as well just, you know,

worry about what's happening
here on our own planet.

Or they could attempt communication,

but communication through time.

And that's almost the most selfless act

of communication because there's no hope

of getting anything back.

It's a philanthropic gift almost

to that other civilization that you can

maybe might just be nothing
more than a monument,

which the pyramids essentially are,

a monument of their existence,

that these are the things they achieved.

This is their, you know,
the things they believed in,

their language, their culture,

or it could be maybe something
more than that and could

be sort of lessons from what they learnt

in their own history.

And so I've been thinking a lot recently

about how would we send a message to other

civilizations in the future,

because that act of thinking seriously

about the engineering of
how we would design it would

inform us about what we
should be looking for

and also perhaps

be our best chance, quite
frankly, of ever making contact.

It might not be the contact we dream of,

but it's still contact.

There would still be a
record of our existence,

as pitiful as it might be,

compared to a two-way communication.

- And I love the humility
behind that project,

that universal project.

- Yeah.
- It's sort of,

it's humble and the...

It humbles you to the vast

temporal landscape of the universe,

just realizing our like
day-to-day lives, they, you know,

all of us will be forgotten.

It's nice to think about
something that sends a signal

out to other...

Yeah.

- It's almost like a humility
of acceptance as well,

of like knowing that you
have a terminal disease,

but your impact on the
Earth doesn't have to end

with your death.

That it could go on beyond
with what you leave behind

for others to discover with
maybe the books you write

or what you leave in the literature...

- Do you think launching
the Roadster vehicle

out in space with the...

- Yeah, the Roadster, I'm
not sure what someone would

make of that if they... (laughs)

- Yeah, that's true.
- I mean,

there have been quasi-attempts
at it beyond the Roadster.

I mean, there's like plaques on,

there's the Pioneer plaques,

there's the Voyager 2 Golden Record.

It's pretty unlikely anybody's
gonna discover those,

because they're just adrift in space

and they will eventually
mechanically die and not

produce any signal for anyone to spot.

So you'd have to be extremely
lucky to come across them.

I've often said to my
colleagues that I think

the best place is the Moon.

The Moon, unlike the Earth,
has no significant weathering.

You know, the how long will
the Apollo descent stages,

which are still sat on the
lunar surface, last for?

The only real effect is
micrometeorites, which are slowly,

like dust, smashing
against them, pretty much.

But that's gonna take millions,

potentially billions of
years to erode that down.

And so we have an opportunity,
and that's on the surface,

if you put something just a
few meters beneath the surface,

it would have even greater protection.

And so it raises the prospect of that,

if we wanted to send something,

a significant amount of
information to a future

galactic spanning
civilization that maybe cracks

the interstellar propulsion problem,

the Moon's gonna be there
for 5 billion years.

That's a long time for somebody to come by

and detect maybe a strange
pattern that we draw

on the sand for them to, you
know, big arrow, big cross,

like look under here,

and we could have a tomb
of knowledge of some record

of our civilization.

And so I think it's, when
you think like that, well,

that implies to us, well, okay,

the galaxy's 13 billion years old,

the Moon is already 4 billion years old.

There may be places familiar
to us, nearby to us,

that we should be seriously
considering as places

we should look for life
and intelligent life

or evidence of relics that
they might leave behind for us.

- So that thinking like
that will help us find such

relics in, it's like a
beneficial cycle that happens.

- [David] Yes. Yeah, exactly.

- That enables the science
of slightly better,

like of searching for bio and
technosignatures and so on.

- Yeah.
- And it's inspiring.

I mean it's also inspiring in
that we wanna leave a legacy

behind as an entire civilization.

Not just in the symbols,
but broadly speaking.

That's lasting, somehow.

- Yeah.

And I'm part of a team
that's trying to repeat

the Golden Record experiment.

We're trying to create
like an open source version

of the Golden Record that
future spacecraft are able

to download and basically
put a little hard drive

that they can carry around
with them and, you know,

get these distributed hopefully across

the Solar System eventually.

- [Lex] And it's gonna be called

the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy?

- Yeah. It could be.

That's a good name for it.

We've been toying a
little bit with the name,

but I think probably just be

Golden Record at this point

or Golden Record version 2 or something.

But I think another benefit
that I see of this activity

is that it forces us as a species to ask

those questions about
what it is that we want

another civilization to know about us.

The Golden Record was kind
of funny because it had

photos on it and it had
photos of people eating,

for instance, but it had no
photos of people defecating.

And so I always thought
that was kind of funny

because if I was an alien, or
if I was studying an alien,

if I saw images of an alien,

I'm not trying to be
like a perv or anything,

but I would wanna see the full,

I wanna understand the
biology of that alien.

And so we always censor
what we show, and...

- We should show the whole
actual natural process,

and then also say we humans
tend to censor these things.

We tend to not like to walk around naked.

We tend to not to talk about some

of the natural biological
phenomena and talk a lot

about others, and actually
just be very like the way

you would be to a therapist or something,

very transparent about the
way we actually operate

in this world.
- Yeah.

I mean, and Sagan had that
with the Golden Record.

I think he originally,

there's a male and a
female figure depicted

on the Golden Record and the woman had

a genitalia originally
drawn and there was a lot

of pushback from I think
a lot of Christian groups

who were not happy about
the idea of throwing

this into space.

And so eventually they had to remove that.

And so it would be confusing biologically,

if you are, you know,

trying to study xenobiology of this alien

that apparently has no
genitalia, or the man does,

but for some reason the
woman doesn't, you know,

and that's our own societal
and cultural imprint

happening into that information.

- That's, to be fair,

just even having two sexes
and predators and prey,

just a whole,

that could be just a very
unique Earth-like thing.

So they might be confused
about why there's like pairs

of things, like why are you, like,

why is there a man and a woman in general?

Like they could be, I mean,

they could be confused about
a lot of things in general.

I don't think the...

- [David] They don't even know which way

to hold the picture.

- Exactly. Or there's the picture.

They don't, they might not need,

they might have very
different sensory devices

to even interpret the system.

- Yeah.

They, if they only, you know,

have sound is their only
way of navigating the world,

it's kind of lost to send
any kind of, you know,

there's been a lot of
conversation about sending

video and pictures.

And that's one of the
things I've been a little

bit resistant about in the
team, that I've been thinking,

well, they might not have eyes.

And so if you lived under Europa surface,

having eyes wouldn't be very useful.

If you lived on a very dark planet,

on the tightly locked
night side of an exoplanet,

having eyes wouldn't
be particularly useful.

So it's kind of a presumption
of us to think that video

is a useful form of communication.

- Do you hope we've become
a multi-planetary species?

So we almost sneaking up to that.

But, you know, the efforts
of SpaceX, of Elon, maybe

in general, what your thoughts
are about those efforts.

So you already mentioned
Starship will be very

interesting for astronomy,
for science in general,

just getting stuff out into space...

But what about the longer term
goal of actually colonizing,

of building civilizations
on other surfaces,

on moons, on planets?

- It seems like an a
fairly obvious thing to do

for our survival, right?

There's a high risk,

if we are committed to trying to keep

this human experiment going,

putting all of our eggs in
one basket is always gonna be

a risky strategy to pursue.

- It's a nice basket though.
- It is a beautiful basket.

I wouldn't want to,

I personally have no interest in living

on Mars or the Moon.

I would like to visit,

but I would definitely
not wanna spend the rest

of my life and die on Mars.

It's a, I mean, it's a hell hole.

Mars is a very, very different...

I think the idea that this is gonna happen

in the next, you know,

10, 20 years is, seems
to be very optimistic.

Not that it's insurmountable,

but the challenges are
extreme to survive on a planet

like Mars, which is, you know,

like a dry frozen desert with
a high radiation environment.

It's a challenge of a type
we've never faced before.

So I'm sure human ingenuity can tackle it,

but I'm skeptical that
we'll have thousands

of people living on Mars in my lifetime.

But I would relish that
opportunity to maybe one day

visit such a settlement, and, you know,

do scientific experiments
on Mars or experience Mars,

do astronomy from Mars, you know,

all sorts of cool stuff you could do.

You know, sometimes you see these dreams

of outer Solar System
exploration and you can like fly

through the clouds

of Venus or you could just
do these enormous jumps

on like these small moons
where you can essentially

jump as high as a
skyscraper and traverse...

I mean, so there's all sorts of, you know,

wonderful ice skating on
Europa that might be fun.

So, didn't get me wrong,

I love the idea of us
becoming interplanetary.

I think it's just a question of time,

our own destructive tendencies,
as you said earlier,

at odds with our emerging capability

to become interplanetary.

And the question is,

will we get out of the nest
before we burn it down?

And I don't know, obviously,
I hope that we do,

but I don't have any
special insight that...

There is a problem,

there is somewhat of a
gnawing intellectual itch

I have with the so-called
doomsday argument,

which I try not to treat too seriously,

but there is some element
of it that bothers me.

The doomsday argument basically
suggests that, you know,

you are typically the
mediocrity principle,

you're not special, that
you're probably gonna be

born somewhere in the
middle of all human beings

who'll ever be born.

You're unlikely to be one
of the first 1% of human

beings that ever lived
and one of the last 1%,

and similarly, the last 1% of human beings

that will ever live.

'Cause you'd be very unique
and special if that were true.

And so by this logic you
can sort of calculate

how many generations of
humans you might expect.

So if there's been, let's say,

100 billion human beings
that have ever lived

on this planet, then you
could say to 95% confidence,

so you divide by 5%, so
100 billion divided by 0.05

would give you 2 trillion
human beings that would

ever live, you'd expect by this argument.

And so if each, let's say each planet,

in general, the planet has
a 10 billion population,

so that would be 200
generations of humans we would

expect ahead of us.

And if each one has an average lifetime,

let's say 100 years, then that
would be about 20,000 years.

So there's 20,000 years left in the clock.

There's like a typical
doomsday argument type.

That's how they typically lay it out.

Now you can argue,

a lot of the criticisms
that doomsday argument come

down to, well, what are
you really counting?

You are counting humans there,

but maybe you should be
counting years or maybe

you should be counting human hours.

You know, because what you
count makes a big difference

to what you get out on the other end.

This is called the reference class.

And so that's one of the big criticisms

of the doomsday argument.

But I do think it has a
compelling point that it would

be surprising if our future
is to one day blossom

and become a galactic spanning empire,

trillions upon trillions upon
trillions of human beings

will one day live across the stars

for essentially as long
as the galaxy exists

and the stars burn.

We would live at an incredibly
special point in that story.

We would be right at the
very, very, very beginning.

And that's not impossible,

but it's just somewhat improbable.

And so there's part of that
sort of irks against me,

but it also almost feels
like a philosophical

argument 'cause you are
sort of talking about souls

being drawn from this cosmic pool.

So it's not an argument that I lose sleep

about for our fate of the doomsday,

but it is somewhat intellectually annoying

that there is a slight
contradiction there, it feels like,

with the idea of a
galactic spanning empire.

- But of course there's so many unknowns.

I, for one, would love
to visit even space,

but Mars, just imagine
standing on Mars and looking

back at Earth.

- Yeah.
- I mean...

- The incredible sight,

it would give you such a fresh perspective

as to your entire existence
and what it meant to be human.

- Yeah. And then come back to Earth.

And it would give you a
heck of a perspective.

Plus the sunset on Mars
is supposed to be nice.

- I loved what William
Shatner said after his flight,

his words really moved
me when he came down.

And I think it really captured the idea

that we shouldn't really
be sending engineers,

or scientists into space,

we should be sending our
poets because those are

the people when they come
down who can truly make

a difference with when they describe

their experiences in space.

And I found it very moving,
reading what he said.

- Yeah.

When you talk to astronauts,

when they describe what they
see, it's like this... (laughs)

Like they discovered a whole new thing

that they can't possibly
convert back into words.

- Yeah.
- It's beautiful to see.

Just as a quick, before I
forget, I have to ask you,

can you summarize your argument against

the hypothesis that we
live in a simulation?

Is it similar to our discussion
about the doomsday clock?

- No, it's actually pretty more similar

to my agnosticism about
life in the universe.

And it's just sort of remaining agnostic

about all possibilities.

The simulation argument,
sometimes it gets mixed.

There's kind of two
distinct things that we need

to consider, one is the
probability that we live

in so-called base reality,

that we are not living in
a simulated reality itself

and another probability
we need to consider

is the probability that
that technology is viable,

possible and something
we will ultimately choose

to one day do.

And those are two distinct things.

They're probably quite
similar numbers to each other,

but they are distinct probabilities.

So in my paper I wrote about this,

I just tried to work through the problem.

I teach astrophysics,

I was actually teaching it this morning.

And so I just seemed like a fun case study

of working through a
Bayesian calculation for it.

Bayesian calculations
work on conditionals.

And so when you hear, you know,

what kind of inspired this
project was when I heard

Musk said was like a billion to one chance

that we don't live in a simulation.

He's right if you add
the Bayesian conditional,

and the Bayesian conditional
is conditioned upon

the fact that we eventually
develop that technology

and choose to use it, or
it's chosen to be used

by such species, by such civilizations.

That's the conditional.

And you have to add that in

because that conditional isn't guaranteed.

And so in a Bayesian
framework you can kind

of make that explicit.

You see mathematically,
explicitly that's a conditional

in your equation.

And the opposite side
of the coin is basically

in the trilemma that Bostrom
originally put forward,

it's options one and two.

So option one is that you
basically never developed

the ability to do that.

Option two is you never
choose to execute that.

So we kind of group those together as sort

of the non-simulation
scenario, let's call it.

And so you've got non-simulation scenario,

and simulation scenario,

and agnostically we really
have to give the, you know,

how do you assess the model,

the a priori model probability
of those two scenarios?

It's very difficult and we can,

I think people would probably argue

about how you as assign those priors.

In the paper we just assigned 50-50,

we said this hasn't been demonstrated yet,

there's no evidence that this is actually

technically possible,

but nor is it it's not
technically possible.

So we're just gonna
assign 50-50 probability

to these two hypotheses.

And then in the hypothesis where you have

a simulated reality, you
have a base reality sat

at the top.

So there is, even in the
simulated hypothesis,

there's a probability you
still live in base reality

and there's a whole myriad
of universes beneath

that which are all simulated.

And so you have a very slim
probability of being in base

reality if this is true.

And you have 100% probability of living

in base reality on the other hand,

if it's not true and we
never develop that ability

or choose never to use it.

And so then you apply this technique

called Bayesian model averaging,

which is where you propagate

the uncertainty of your two models to get

out a final estimate.

And because of that one
base reality that lives

in this simulated scenario,

you end up counting
this up and getting the,

it always has to be less than 50%.

So the probability to live

in a simulated reality
versus a base reality has

to be slightly less than 50%.

Now that really comes down
to that statement of giving

it 50-50 odds to begin with.

And on the one hand you might say, look,

David, I'm, you know, I work
in artificial intelligence,

I'm very confident that
this is gonna happen

just of extrapolating of current trends.

Or on the other hand, a
statistician would say,

you are giving way too much weight

to the simulation hypothesis 'cause

it's an intrinsically
highly complicated model.

You have a whole hierarchy of realities

within realities within realities.

It's like the inception
style thing, right?

And so this requires hundreds, thousands,

millions of parameterizations to describe.

And by Occam's razor we
would always normally

penalize inherently complicated
models as being disfavored.

So I think you could argue
I'm being too generous

or too kind with that,

but I sort of want to develop the rigorous

mathematical tools to explore it.

And ultimately it's up to you to decide

what you think that 50-50 odds should be.

But you can use my formula
to plug in whatever

you want and get the answer.

And I use 50-50.

- And but when in that first pile,

with the first two parts
that the Bostrom talks about,

it seems like connected
to that is the question

we've been talking about,

which is the number of
times at bat you get,

which is the number

of intelligence civilizations that are

out there that can build such simulations.

It seems like very closely connected,

'cause if we're the
only ones that are here

and that could build such
things, that changes things.

- Yeah. Yeah.

I mean this, yeah,

the simulation palace has all sorts

of implications like that.

I've always lived, Sean
Carroll pointed out

a really interesting contradiction,

apparently, with the simulation hypothesis

that I speak about a
little bit in the paper.

But he showed that,

or pointed out that in this
hierarchy of realities,

which then develop their
own AIs within the realities

and then they, or really
ancestor simulations,

I should say, rather than AI, they develop

their own capability
to simulate realities.

You get this hierarchy.

And so eventually there'll
be a bottom layer,

which I often call the sewer of reality.

It's like the worst layer

where it's the most pixelated
it could possibly be, right?

So because each layer is
necessarily gonna have

less computational power
than the layer above it,

because not only are you
simulating that entire planet,

but also some of that's being used

for the computers themselves
that those that are simulated.

And so that base reality or
certain, the sewer reality

is a reality where they are simply unable

to produce ancestor simulations
because the fidelity

of the simulation is not sufficient.

And so from their point of view,

it might not be obvious that
the universe is pixelated,

but they would just never be able

to manifest that capability.

- What if they're constantly simulating...

'Cause in order to appreciate the limits

of the fidelity, you
have to have an observer.

What if they're always simulating a dumber

and dumber observer?
- Yeah.

- What if the sewer has very
dumb observers, they can't,

like scientists that are the
dumbest possible scientists.

So like it's very pixelated,

but the scientists are too dumb
to even see the pixelations.

- Right.
- So like that's,

like built into the
universe always has to be

a limitation on the cognitive capabilities

of the complex systems that are within it.

- Yeah.

So that sewer of reality,

they would still
presumably be able to have

very impressive
computational capabilities,

they'd probably be able to
simulate galactic formation

or this kind of impressive stuff.

But they would be just
short of the ability to,

however you define it,

create a truly sentient conscious
experience in a computer,

that would just be just
beyond their capabilities.

And so Carroll pointed out
that if you add up all the,

you know, you count up how
many realities there should be,

probabilistically, if
this is true, over here,

the simulation hypothesis or scenario,

then you are most likely to find yourself

in the sewer because there's
just far more of them

than there are of any
of the higher levels.

And so that sort of
sets up a contradiction

because then you live in a reality

which is inherently incapable of ever

producing ancestor simulations.

But the premise of the entire argument

is that ancestor simulations are possible.

There's a contradiction.

- There's that old quote,
we're all living in the sewer,

but some of us are
looking up at the stars.

Maybe...

- [David] This is may be
more true than we think.

- But to me,

so there's of course
physics and computational

fascinating questions here.

But to me there's a practical
psychological question

which is, you know,

how do you create a virtual reality world

that is as compelling,

and not necessarily even as realistic,

but almost as realistic,

but as compelling or more
compelling than physical reality?

'Cause something tells me
it's not very difficult,

in a full history of human civilization.

That is an interesting
kind of simulation to me,

because that feels like
is doable in the next

hundred years, creating a
world where we all prefer

to live in the digital world.

And not like a visit,
but like, it's, like,

you're seen as insane...

No, like you're required,

it's unsafe to live outside
of the virtual world.

And it's interesting to
me from an engineering

perspective how to build
that because I'm somebody

that sort of loves video games,

and it seems like you can
create incredible worlds

there and stay there.

And it's a different
question than creating

a ultra high resolution,

high fidelity simulation of physics.

But if that world inside a
video game is as consistent

as the physics of our reality,

then you could have your
own scientists in that world

that trying to understand
that physics world,

it might look different...

- And presumably they'd
eventually forget, you know,

give it long enough,

they might forget about
their origins of being

once biological and assume
this is their only reality.

- Especially if you're
now born, you know, well,

certainly if you're born,

but even if you were eight
years old or something

when you first started
wearing the headset.

- Yeah. Or you have a
memory wipe when you go in.

I mean, it also kind of
maybe speaks to this issue

of like Neurolink and how do we keep up

with AI in our world,

if you want to augment your intelligence,

perhaps one way of competing,

and the one of your impetus for going

into this digital reality would be to be

competitive intellectually
with artificial intelligences

that you could trivially
augment your reality

if your brain was itself artificial.

But I mean, one skepticism in my voice had

about that is whether,

it's more a philosophical question,

but how much is that really
you, if you do a mind upload,

is this just a duplicate of
your memories that thinks

it's you versus truly a transference

of your conscious stream
into that reality?

And I think when you...

It's almost like the teleportation device

in "Star Trek," but with teleportation,

quantum teleportation,
you can kind of rigorously

show that, you know,

as long as all of the quantum numbers are

exactly duplicated as you transfer over,

it truly is from the
university's perspective,

in every way, indistinguishable
from what was there before.

It really is, in principle, you

in all the sense of being you,

versus creating a duplicate
clone and uploading

memories to that human body or a computer

that would surely be a discontinuation

of that conscious experience
by virtue of the fact

you've multiplied it.

And so I would be hesitant
about uploading for that reason.

I would see it mostly as my own,

killing myself and having
some AI duplicate of me

that persists in this world,

but is not truly my experience.

- Typical 20th century human

with an attachment to this particular

singular instantiation of brain and body.

How silly humans used to be,

used to have rotary phones
and other silly things.

You're an incredible human being.

You're an educator, you're a researcher.

You have like an amazing
YouTube channel...

Looking to young people, if
you were to give 'em advice,

how can they have a career that
maybe is inspired by yours,

inspired by wonder and curiosity,

a career they can be proud of,

or a life they can be proud of?

What advice would you give?

- I certainly think in terms
of a career in science,

one thing that I maybe
discovered late but has

been incredibly influential on me in terms

of my own happiness and
my own productivity,

has been this synergy of
doing two passions at once.

One passion in science communication,

and another passion research,

and not surrendering either one.

And I think that tends
to be seen as something

that's an either or.

You have to completely dedicate
your yourself to one thing

to gain mastery in it.

That's a conventional way
of thinking about both

science and other disciplines.

And I have found that
both have been elevated

by practicing in each,

and I think that's true
in all assets of life.

I mean, if you want to
become the best researcher

you possibly can, you are
pushing your intellect

and in a sense your body to a high level.

And so to me,

I've always wanted to couple
that with training of my body,

training of my mind in other ways besides

from just what I'm doing
when I'm in the lecture room

or when I'm in my office, you
know, calculating something.

Focusing on your own development
through whatever it is,

meditation for me, it's
often running, working out,

and pursuing multiple passions provides

this almost synergistic bliss
of all of them together.

So often I've had some of
the best research ideas

from making a YouTube video
and trying to communicate

an idea or interacting
with my audience who've had

a question that sparked
a whole trail of thought

that led down this wonderful
intellectual rabbit hole.

Or maybe to a new intellectual discovery,

can go either way sometimes
with those things.

And so thinking broadly,

diversely and always
looking after yourself

in this highly competitive
and often extremely

stressful world that we live in,

is the best advice I can offer anybody.

And just try, if you can
to, it's very cheesy,

but if you can follow your passions,

you'll always be happy.

Trying to sell out for the quick cash out,

for the quick buck out can be
tempting in the short term.

Looking for exomoons was never easy,

but I made a career not out
of discovering exomoons,

but out of learning how to communicate

the difficult problem
and discovering all sorts

of things along the way.

You know, we shot for the
sky and we discovered all

this stuff along the way.

We discovered dozens of
new planets using all sorts

of new techniques, we
pushed this instrumentation

to new places, and I've had an extremely

productive research career in this world.

I've had all sorts of ideas
working on technosignatures.

It's, you know, thinking
innovatively pushes

you into all sorts of exciting directions.

So just try to, yeah,

it's hard to find that passion,

but you can sometimes remember
it when you were a kid,

what your passions were and
what fascinated you as a child?

For me, as soon as I
picked up a space book

when I was five years old, that was it,

I was hooked on space, and I
almost betrayed my passion,

in college I studied physics,

which I've always been
fascinated by physics as well,

but I came back to astronomy
because it was my first love

and I was much happier doing research

in astronomy than I was in
physics because it spoke

to that wonder I had as a child,

that first was the spark of
curiosity for me in science.

- So society will try to get
you to look at hot Jupiters.

- [David] Yeah.

- And the advice is to look
for the cool world instead.

What do you think is the
meaning of this whole thing?

You ever ask yourself why?

- It's just a ride.
- That's a ride?

- It's just a ride.

We're on a rollercoaster
and we have no purpose,

it's an accident in my perspective,

there's no meaning to my life,

there's no objective,
deity who is overwatching

what I'm doing, and I
have some fate or destiny.

It's all just riding on the
rollercoaster and trying

to have a good time and contribute

to other people's enjoyment of the ride.

- Yeah. Try to make it a happy accident.

- Yeah. Yeah.

I see no fundamental providence in my life

or in the nature of the universe.

And you just see this
universe as this beautiful

cosmic accident of
galaxy smashing together,

stars forging here and there,

and planets occasionally
spawning maybe life

across the universe.

And we are just one of
those instantiations

and we should just enjoy
this very brief episode

that we have.

And I think trying to look at
it much deeper than that is,

to me, is not very soul satisfying.

I just think, enjoy what
you've got and appreciate it.

- It does seem noticing
that beauty helps make

the ride pretty fun.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

- David, you're an incredible person.

I haven't covered most of
the things I wanted to talk

to you about.

This was an incredible conversation.

I just, I'm glad you exist.

I'm glad you're doing
everything you're doing,

and I'm a huge fan.

Thank you so much for talking
today. This was amazing.

- Thank you so much,
Lex. It's a real honor.

Thank you.

- Thanks for listening
to this conversation

with David Kipping.

And now let me leave you some words

from Carl Sagan: "Perhaps
the aliens are here,

but are hiding because
of some Lex Galactica

some ethic of non-interference

with emerging civilizations.

We can imagine them,
curious and dispassionate,

observing us, as we would
watch a bacterial culture

in a dish to determine
whether this year, again,

we managed to avoid self-destruction."

Thank you for listening and
hope to see you next time.

- Narcissism is not arrogance.

No, narcissism is the
opposite of arrogance.

There is such a deep sense of inadequacy

and incompetence in the self

that the defensive structure around that

becomes dominated by rocket-fueled envy.

- The following is a
conversation with Paul Conti,

a psychiatrist and a brilliant
scholar of human nature.

My friend, Andrew Huberman, told me

that Paul and I absolutely
must meet and talk,

not just about the topic of trauma,

which Paul wrote an amazing book about,

but broadly about human
nature, about narcissism,

sociopathy, psychopathy, good and evil,

hate and love, happiness and envy.

As usual, Andrew was right.

This was a fascinating conversation.

As the old meme goes, one does not simply

doubt the advice of Andrew Huberman.

Allow me to also quickly mention

that I disagree with Paul
a bunch in this episode,

as I do in other episodes,
even with experts.

In part for fun and in part
because I think the tension

of ideas and conversation is

what creates insights and wisdom.

My goal is to always
empathize, understand,

and explore ideas of the
person sitting across from me.

This agreement is just one of the ways

I think it's fun to do just that,

as long as I do so from a place

of curiosity and compassion.

And now, dear friends, here's Paul Conti.

Do you see psychiatry
as fundamentally a study

of the human mind and
not just the set of tools

for treating psychological maladies?

- Absolutely, I think
psychiatry is our best way

to understand who we are as people.

I mean, it looks at our biology,

how does our brain work?

How does it connect the
parts with one another?

How does the chemistry in it work?

It's the very foundational
aspects of who we are

and then it manifests as psychology.

What do we think, what do we feel?

What are our strivings,
what are our fears?

So yeah, I think psychiatry provides tools

that we can use to help each other.

But those tools come through it

being a discipline of understanding.

- So with every patient you see,

with every mind you explore,

are you picking up a deeper
understanding of the human mind?

- I think I'm trying to,
I think we should learn,

we should be able to take something away

from everything we do,

every interaction to some small degree.

- Every conversation that
doesn't have to be a patient?

Just anywhere, at
Starbucks, getting a coffee?

You can learn something
from that little experience?

- Yeah, even if you just
reinforce sort of gentle kindness

and gratitude and decent
human interaction.

There's a reinforcement of that,

that even if we don't take
away memories or lessons,

so to speak, we can reinforce
who we choose to be.

- So understanding ourselves
from those interactions too,

not just the general sort
of philosophical human mind,

but understanding our own mind,

introspect on how our own mind works.

- Yeah, 'cause everything
we understand about anyone

or anything else is coming
through here, right?

So yeah, if we're--
- It's all in there.

- Understanding others, we're
also understanding ourselves.

It's all feeding through us, yeah.

- Yeah, but it's a
tricky thing to step away

and look in your own mind

and understand that it's just a machine.

And you can kinda control that
way the machine processes,

the external environment and
the way that machine converts,

the things it perceives
into actual emotions,

like how it interprets
the things it perceives.

You just sort of step away
and analyze it in that way,

and then you can control it.

You can oil the machine,

you can control how it actually
interprets the perceptions

in order to generate positive emotions

and be like a, what is it?

Like a mechanic

for the gears in the machine.

- I mean, I think to some
degree, to some degree.

But the difference, I think,
at least as I understand,

I think of machines as not
being inscrutable, right?

That if there's enough study,

there's enough acumen applied,

that we can understand whatever it is

we're trying to figure out.

Whereas part of understanding
ourselves is understanding

that there are things we can't understand.

And I think that's

indispensably important, I
think, to health and happiness.

And also, to having enough humility

to see how people can
be different from us,

how we can be different
from ourselves at times.

So knowing that we don't know a lot

and having some idea
of what that might be,

I think is an indispensable
part of the process,

which I think is different
from machines, I think.

- Yeah, the machines,
you're basically saying

machines generally because
they're engineered from a design,

they're usually going to be simpler,

therefore understandable.

And you're saying the
complexity of the human mind is,

at least from our
perspective, nearly infinite.

- Is there a meta phenomena,

what sometimes gets described
as sort of levels of emergence

where at increasing levels of complexity,

you have novelty evolved
that you can't predict

from lower levels of complexity.

Like for example, atoms to molecules.

It's just one example.

I think neurons to consciousness,

consciousness to culture, right?

That there are meta
phenomena that separate

from the phenomena underneath of them

and thereby add an
entire aspect of novelty.

So I think we are, I mean,
I really think this is true,

that we are all infinitely fascinating

because these levels of
emergence, of novelty,

that are inscrutable,

because you can't predict
from one level to the next

or understand fully are what
make us, and not just us,

but I think sentient creatures, right?

Human beings, but sentient creatures

inestimably more interesting

than creatures that aren't sentient.

And I don't know, I think when we think

about machine learning and
artificial intelligence,

I think it's that that
we're trying to create,

the levels of emergence that now,

we don't fully understand anymore,

which I guess is both
exciting and maybe scary too.

- Yeah, so you start at
the physics of atoms,

quantum mechanics, go into
chemistry, go into biology.

From the biology, you have
the functional phenomena,

especially as manifested
in the human brain,

and then multiple brains
connecting together through

consciousness and intelligence
creates civilizations.

It's pretty interesting.

Where do you think the magic
is, at which layer of the cake?

- Every layer, because
every time you emerge

from one thing to another,
I see it as an analog,

the concept of the dialectic, right?

Where I think it was Hegel who realized,

hey, when you have like
thing A and thing B

and they're complicated
and they come together,

you don't get a hybrid of A and B, right?

You end up getting something
that's new, that's novel.

And I think that describes
to some degree that like

what emergence is, except there's,

there's a whole new,
it's universe of novelty

that comes at each layer of emergence

that allows infinite possibilities

that weren't possible before.

And I think that's why
we're so complicated,

our functional neuroscience,

which I think is psychology,

our ability to think about ourselves,

about others, to be reflective,

is sitting on top of so
many layers of emergence.

Like the idea of standing
on the shoulders of giants,

each of us, our consciousness is standing

on the shoulder of a giant of many,

many, many levels of
emergence, of novelty,

so many of which we don't understand.

I mean subatomic particles, everything

that quantum physics means.

When does time become important?

As opposed to things
happening outside of time

and outside of space.

When do we slot into one
temporal perspective?

And then the complexity just, I think,

grows and grows and grows.

- Yeah, the interesting
word you use is "novelty."

If true, this really blows my mind

in some either shallow or
deep sense, it is true.

I'm trying to figure that out.

I don't know if you know
something about cellular automata,

is this very simple mathematical objects

where you have rules that govern
each individual little cell

and they interact locally.

And that, you understand
the very simple operation

of those individual cells.

But at another layer of abstraction,

when you just kinda zoom
out with blurry vision,

these meta objects starts
appearing that function.

You could build a Turing machine with it,

you can build an arbitrary complexity

of computation on top of this
kinda very simple object.

- Yes.
- It's an interesting question

whether that was always there.

The atoms somehow know about love, right?

Like about consciousness.

About war and violence and
evil and hate and all that.

That's already laid in,
the possibility of that,

the capacity for that,
it's already in the atoms.

It's already in the physics,
it's already in the,

in all the different
chemistry, and that builds up.

Even the origin of life, still a mystery.

That's known, that's in the physics.

That's known to the universe,

the basic background
physics in the universe.

'Cause if that's not the case,

it's like, where is that come from?

Where's that magic?

And how many layers can
the cake possibly have?

How many are we gonna keep building?

If we're constantly through
this process of abstraction,

of adding a layer to the
cake, adding novel things,

like where's the ceiling?

As we expand on into the cosmos,

if we successfully can do that,

are we gonna keep building
like more miraculous,

complex objects, and then the brain

is just like a middle layer thing?

We tend to think of ourselves as

a truly, truly special manifestations

of what's possible in the universe.

But maybe we're just like the basic,

like tiny building block of something

much, much, much bigger.

We're in the early days of being a brick

and a very large building.

- Sure.

Look, I think that's entirely possible.

I mean, I think the only emergent thing,

so to speak that we
build is culture, right?

The aggregation of us.

So you have individual human minds,

which you are entirely unique.

I mean, even the fact that time

is different for you and me, right?

It may be by picoseconds, right?

But we can engage because

our perceptions of time
are parallel enough.

They're close enough, right?

That we can share a reality, right?

But we're all living

in a different dimension of time, right?

I mean, we know that, right?

So we're unique in that way.

And then the unique individuals

that we are just like the cells, right?

Start to create not just one
thing, not just a culture,

but culture on top of
our individuality, right?

There are our uniqueness are
even dimensional uniqueness

of time and experience and consciousness.

So we create cultures on top of us,

but what could be beyond culture, right?

And what is different from us either

on underlying levels like, you know,

like quantum physics
or chemistry or biology

or entirely different in
unconceived, I think is,

it's an immense question.
And I think it's one that

should create humility in us, right?

That look how much we don't know,

and then how reckless
we are with ourselves,

with our resources, with human life.

And I think there, it's
important to say, I mean,

think about how entropy
rules the universe around us.

I mean, how over selected are we?

How many?

Not just hundreds or thousands of times,

but how many millions of
times does there have to be

a selection branch point before we get

into a sort of eddie pool
of counter entropy, right?

Where you can begin to create, right?

Which I think is why you say, okay,

the atoms know about love, right?

The fact that anything is being
created right means there's

this over selection for
counter entropy where

there can be a building
of greater complexity

of ultimately of novelty.

And we don't often think about that

of how far removed we
are, maybe light years,

so to speak, from any
other location temporarily,

physically in the universe
where this could happen.

And we don't think about
what does that mean?

- Everything that you said, love,

everything is counter entropy goes against

the way the basic physics of the universe.

So maybe actually the
atoms really don't like

what we're doing.

They want us to stop.

They've been trying really hard to stop.

And despite that,

we somehow started this
whole bacteria thing

for like a billion years.

And now we're here.

- I actually think of
it kinda the other way.

I don't think there's any purpose
to purposelessness, right?

So why would anything be here

if the drive weren't
towards creativity, right?

If the drive weren't towards
those subatomic particles

not being nothingness that blips

in and out of existence, right?

Like we think is going on
in empty space, you know,

for light years upon light years, right?

But is there a design either natural

or intentional for schema, right?

A scenario that allows
for the incredibly rare

but not non-existent eddie
pool of counter entropy

where good can happen, right?

Where creativity can happen,

where ultimately something can grow,

something novel can happen.

There's no novelty in
the vastness of space,

even though there's not nothing there.

There's novelty here
because I think the layers

of emergence start stacking very, very,

very high when we're in the
a place of counter entropy,

which then could provide
even thoughts about

like good and evil, right?

The idea that creating, that
preserving is good, right?

It's what we build upon.

It's how we get to the eddie
pool of counter entropy, right?

So then destruction is not good.

You know, what good comes

of aggression and destruction, right?

You know, unless we're
protecting, or even you can think

of out outlying cases,

but just think in general concepts, right?

Like destruction destroys,

it brings us towards a state of entropy,

towards a state of nothingness.

Whereas goodness, commonality,
collaboration, right?

Nurturing right, brings novelty.

It brings new existence into the universe.

And I think

we don't think about that the way this,

we're in the middle of something so vast

and built on top of so many layers.

And I think it leads us to be cavalier,

you know, with human life,
including often our own.

- So you think

there's a underlying creative
force to the universe

that might even have a kind
of built in morality to it

where creating is better than destroying.

And then that somehow maps on
onto our society where we kind

of try to figure out
what that actually means

in terms of good and evil.

So that's something is there
like that, but it's like,

but it has to be, it's like so nice,

it's so perfect 'cause it's rare.

It's sufficiently rare
where we have our own space.

Like you can like close
the door and it's like,

I need to be alone right now
as our human civilization

to work on my thing.

So it's sufficiently rare
that there's not other alien

civilizations that are just
like constantly knocking

on our door, destroying
us, but it still exists.

That's weird.

- Right? Right.

It's so fantastically improbable,

that I think we should
be very respectful of it.

And I think you said
there's a creative force

that values creativity, right?

Things would be,

well sure if it's a creative force, right?

Its existence,

its ability to exist and to
create comes from something

other than entropy, right?

Something other than so much dispersion

that there's nothingness, right?

So the creative force will value

the sanctity of things, right?

You know, keeping things together,

not destroying things, right?

Building novelty, including
novelty of knowledge,

novelty of sanctions.

I mean, it fits with the
idea that we're not nothing,

that that's incredibly improbable
and that there are these

many, many layers of emergence
that we're standing upon.

And I think it tells us
something that we're not doing

ourselves a service to ignore, right?

It's not just a jump to saying, oh,

there's a religious answer to everything.

It's just, no,

it's saying science isn't
a god either, right?

So if we think of science as a tool

and not as an endpoint in and of itself,

what is the science telling us?

Like I remember showing
up at medical school

and it really is true.

I mean, I knew so little
about the human body.

I'd only been in
hospitals to visit people.

I'd taken pre-med classes,

but sort of intensely at
once after I didn't take any

and I was working in business,
I knew next to nothing.

And I had this idea that
was so naive in retrospect

that I was gonna learn so much, right?

I was gonna answer these questions

'cause I was gonna learn
what's going on in the body.

What are these organs doing?

What are these cells?

And what I learned was
there was so much more

that was amazing and mysterious
and seemingly impossible.

Like even how a cell functions, right?

Like what is going on inside of a cell,

the transport mechanisms
and energy functions

and diffusion functions.

And then you can go down to
smaller levels than that.

But when you come back out and you say,

how will those cells make a kidney?

It's not explanatory.

You know, I remember asking the OB

who had delivered my first child, right?

I was so amazed.

And I asked him like, what do you think?

Like what do you know? You do this, right?

You're seeing this life
created and, you know,

and his thought was,
"Nothing. I just marvel.

You know, I mean I get to do this,

but I just marvel at it."

And I think the more we know about us,

the more we respectfully marvel.

- And we should do that.

We should proactively
marvel at every aspect,

at every layer that where
the novelty emerges.

- Yes, we'd be a lot
less likely to say, Hey,

I don't like you because of
something, whatever it is,

you know, race, religion,
culture, sexuality,

gender identity, whatever it
is, you know, or I wanna take,

I want rights that you don't have. Right?

Or I want what you have. Right?

I mean, there's so much of this,

and I understand it's driven by scarcity

and by human insecurity and
envy and all of these things

that I think drive us towards destruction.

But all of that recklessness
comes from not having this

initial appreciation and
respect that you're referring to

and just marveling at like,
wow, okay, we're here.

That's amazing. Let's start with that.

- But if we marvel at this
whole thing, the human project,

the human condition that
all the different kinds

of human beings that are possible,

what do you then make of that?

Some humans do evil onto the world.

First of all, are all human
beings capable of evil?

If we're in the process
now we've got a little bit

of momentum in terms of
marveling the layers of the cake.

Should we also marvel at the
capacity for evil in all of us?

Is that capacity there?

- I believe that it is, yes.

- So what do we understand
about the psychology of evil?

Where does that originate
in the human mind?

Is it there in the neurobiology?

Is it there in the
environment, in the upbringing?

- Can I clarify first?

I think the capacity for evil,

I do believe is in all of us,

there's a difference between enacting evil

and a a sort of preset, followed,

developed plan of evil, right?

I don't believe that all of us are capable

of doing what the people

who perpetrate the most evil do, right?

But I do believe that we're capable

of perpetrating evil, right?

And one thought would be
that there are drives in us.

I mean, there certainly seem to be

drives in us towards survival,

towards gratification in
some ways, towards pleasure.

And that can get very complicated

'cause pleasure inside
can be relief of distress.

So if I feel very badly about myself

and I can feel a little
better about myself

by making you feel worse
about yourself, right?

Which that plays out in
a lot of human beings.

Is that an indirect way of
bringing pleasure? Right?

So it gets very complicated
what's going on inside of us.

And sometimes the perpetration
of evil things can be

through misunderstandings,
anger, impulsivity.

I mean the things that we can have in us.

And other times there can be,

there can be other things going on

which are through the lens of
unhealthy human psychology.

So for example, the psychology of envy,

which I think drives the lion share

of the orchestrated evil, right?

There's a difference between impulsive,

reflexive evil and
highly orchestrated evil,

which I think is driven by envy.

- Highly orchestrated evil.

Are we talking about a scale of societies

like totalitarianism?

So if we're thinking about
somebody like Hitler,

so at scale orchestration
of evil, envy driving that.

So I mean, that's really
interesting to think about.

I'd love to hear more about it.

So some of it,

there might be some psychological forces

that are intention with each other.

So one is, if you look
at somebody like Hitler,

It's difficult to know what
was going on in his mind.

But it's possible to imagine
if you just look at dictator's

thought history that he
thought he was doing good,

not just for himself,

but for the people he believed have value.

So one way you can have,

you can achieve what we consider as evil

is by devaluing some group of people.

And that could be all group of people.

So it could have sort of a
narcissistic type of idea

that you basically don't care
about other human beings.

That's one, envy is different.

I mean, maybe they can
collaborate together,

or even like you mentioned,

you can actually enjoy
doing bad to others.

That's almost like different because

if all it is like
narcissism, you disregard,

you don't care what, how others feel,

then you can just make
cold, calculated, military

almost economic decisions.

And you don't care if a million
people die here or there.

But if you actually enjoy
some aspect of that,

or there is like a
resentment that fuels it.

It's not just cold calculation,

it's like fueled by some kind of personal

or cultural resentment.

- I think it's all fueled by that.

- You think so?

- I think it's all fueled by that.

I think the idea that the Hitler
thought he was doing good.

Is like,

that is such a thin
facade that it flies away

like a handkerchief in hurricane, right?

That...

- Okay? Yeah.

Thank you. That's wow, that's beautiful.

Yeah.

- It's built upon, like it says,

I'll explain logical lies, right?

Because people can build lies
upon species logic, right?

So the idea that, okay,

I am doing good because I believe that

this ethnicity of people
is good and this is bad,

and now I'm going to do this

and I'm gonna make the world different

and it's gonna bring better to the world.

And now I'm raising armies

and I'm building concentration camps.

And I think like this is
all on the surface of good

is I don't think anyone
ever thinks that, right?

Or they think that, but with,

because they're living in
the surface patina, right?

Like they're not allowing
the hurricane in that

blows away the handkerchief and says like,

this is all evil, right?

I mean, how do you decide that
some group of people is good

and some is bad?

And like, what is it that
you take upon yourself

to play God or make
decisions about the world?

And I think what really
is going on is that people

are not doing that, right?

There's something cobbled
together to say like,

why this is right and this is okay, right?

And this is even good, right?

But it is all a lie, right?

It's a lie that's adorning.

What I believe is the fact I believe that

what's going on is the
gratification of envy

inside of the person.

And whether someone says, oh,

I think this is good and it's
okay if a million people die

or I'm gonna enjoy that
a million people die,

I think is the same.

I think the the enjoyment,

the gratification of the
orchestrated evil is there.

And that it all comes from
vulnerability and insecurity.

It all comes from deficits
in the sense of self, right?

- I'm gonna have to process that.

My slow penny and PC is processing that.

So envy underlies all of it.

The psychological concept
of envy. What is that?

I keep putting myself
in the mind of Hitler.

I guess, that has nothing to do.

It doesn't have to do
with Jews or slavi people.

Does it have to do with
specific a morphous other

in his mind that he's envious of.

- I think it has all to do
with him, all to do with him.

There's not a love of the
people with whom he allied,

or even a sense of the people

who he persecuted were worse than him.

It's all projections out of
what was going on inside of him,

which was an intense sense of inadequacy.

A rage at being someone he
perceived as lesser than.

That's the difference between,

so we can define words in different ways,

even within psychology, but let's say

we take the definition
here of sort of jealousy

as being sort of benign, right?

The idea that, oh,

I might see something
that you have that I don't

and I might think I'd like that,

maybe I'll work harder to get it, right,

or maybe I can't get it.

Maybe it's that you're younger than I am.

They say, okay,

you know, okay, you know, you
have that and I don't, I mean,

I have other things too, I'm okay anyway,

but I might want those
things, but it's very benign.

The jealousy.

I'd like to like to be
younger, I'd like to be richer,

whatever it is that we
people think, right?

But it's just a thought and it's a thought

that can result in strivings
or acceptance, right?

It's very, very different.

It's completely different than envy,

which is destructive.

It's a thought of,

I see something that you have
that I don't have, right?

And instead of me working for it

or accepting that I don't have it,

what I'd like to do
then is bring you down,

take you down to where I am,

and then I'll feel better, right?

Because from the perspective of envy,

it is all relative.

- So it's jealousy, a kind of,

'cause he said completely different.

But is jealousy potentially
like a gateway drug to envy?

Like does it, like is it a slippery slope?

- I think, no,

I think that jealousy
is a natural just part

of the human phenomenon
that we go through life

and we see like, oh,
I'd like to have that.

I think it's probably part
of our incentives, right?

If, you know,

if I'm farming and I have one row of crops

and I look over and I see
that you're working harder

and you have two,

and I'd like to have two,

that can make me work harder to have two.

- You don't think it's a slippery slope

from one to the other
to, at first you're like,

I'd like to work harder,

but then you keep failing
and the weather sucks

and you keep failing and the other person

becomes more successful.

Plus he's got a new hot wife
now, there's a nice tractor,

there's a field is all working,

and then you get this
idea that, you know what?

I'm gonna steal all this stuff.

I'm gonna murder him and that.

Do you know, don't you think
that's just like a leap-

- No, I actually think-
- Of the same phenomenon?

- No, because I think there are things

that are in us as humans, right?

So the the things that
just by being human,

like we can, for example feel,

we can feel compassion, right?

We can feel interest, right?

We can feel jealousy in that benign sense.

Like it's all part of just being human.

If we start going from, hey,

you have more crops than
I have and you know,

that seems like I actually
have a better life

in a lot of ways than I
have, I'm gonna kill you.

That's not,

that is not a progression
of something benign, right?

That is-
- But wait, wait a minute.

But that is a human leap of
the same thing, isn't it?

Is because you're drawing a line stuff.

You're saying like,

this is the, this human
stuff, this regular life,

it's benign, but it feels
like this benign thing is just

a low magnitude thing,

version of the thing that's not benign.

Like there's probably a gray
area where it stops being,

but like jealousy, you can
have like healthy jealousy.

You can have a little
bit slightly unhealthy.

That's I think, jealous guy.

This John Len song that
I love is just beautiful.

I mean, there's like this
jealousy inside relationships

can make you feel like, you know,

could take your minds in all
kinds of silly directions.

And it's crazy.

But like,

it feels like that's an
next door neighbor to like,

being really crazy and toxic

and all that kind of stuff
inside relationships.

And then that feels like
an next door neighbor.

It's like an apartment
building that feels like

a next door neighbor

that eventually gets the Hitler

with envy and resentment of an
entire population of people.

- You're right that there's a causal,

there can be a causal chain, right?

Like if I'm not feeling jealous,

maybe I won't ever feel envious, right?

So you can see, okay, so
it can kind of lead to,

it can open gates to, huh?

Like how much do I dislike
that you have things

that I don't have, right?

So yes, in that sense, but,

and I think this is the
part I think is so important

that I think there is
a disjunction, right?

It's there's an asymptotic shift, right?

From one thing to another because it is-

- Now you're speaking my
language, mathematically, yep.

- Yes, it's a way to convey, right?

Something that's entirely different.

Because if I start thinking, you know,

I'm not gonna try and
make things better, right?

I'd like instead to harm you.

That's qualitatively different.

- Oh, it's almost like, you
know what it is, it could be,

I don't know what you think about this,

but it's in which direction
your motivation is pointing.

So if in the response to
the feeling of jealousy,

your sort of, the motivation says, okay,

I understand this feeling,
I want to do less of it.

I think there must be a threshold

to which you actually wanna do more of.

Like, it becomes a vicious downward cycle.

So that's what envy becomes
like the first feeling,

this idea that I'm gonna
kill the farmer, right?

Turns into like more and more
and more and you can't sleep

and you're visualizing the
farmer and it becomes the devil.

And like you have this very, you know,

it is basically a thing that builds

into the negative direction versus returns

to the stable center.

- Now a person is cultivating evil.

Right, they're saying, Hey,

there can be seeds of evil in all of us.

Let me take that seed out,
dust it off, plant it,

nurture it, right?

And then grow that seed of evil,

which will affect all other parts

of the person's life, right?

They won't behave the same
towards others in their life.

They'll become different as
they nurture fantasies of evil

as they begin to create
inside of themselves

the motivation and the will, right?

To enact evil, right?

The Hitler analogy would say, look,

you take someone who had
a bad childhood, right?

Who like was not loved,

who was taught and told
that he was less than, okay?

Like that we know that happens.

I mean, that's why a child
abuse is so evil, right?

It's telling children

the worst possible wrong lessons, right?

They're not good enough.
They'll always be hurt.

You know, they can't keep themselves safe.

They don't deserve safety, right?

So then you take someone who then nurtures

that seed of evil, which
is a choice and says,

why I can't paint well enough
and no one appreciates me

and I don't like how I look

and I don't fit in with the
people I want to fit in with.

And then, and on and on
and on and on and on.

And there's a hatred of self
through that lens of misery

of just being repulsed by the self.

But that's unacceptable to the self.

So, oh, it has to be
someone else's fault, right?

It's not my fault. Whose fault is it?

Right?

And then you see on mass
the inaction of evil

towards groups of people

who somehow in this person's mind, right,

are responsible for his misery and theirs.

The justification of evil.

And then all the, you know,

whether it's this will be
better for the economy,

this will be good, this
will be that, like,

that that's all lies
built to justify the evil.

- Those are surface love narratives.

- Yes.

- And the envy is the deep
dom mechanism that enables.

- And that's the endpoint
that's being served.

What's being served is destruction, right?

Which is why it always brings
more destruction, right?

I mean, how many times
do wars that were started

for purposes that we would look

and say like that those
were evil purposes.

Like how many times
does good come of that?

Even if we look at the modern world,

what comes of it is more
evil, is more destruction.

And Hitler's outward destruction
eventually came inward.

And, you know,

you see pictures of
what Berlin looked like

after the second World War, right?

It wasn't just destruction,
perpetrated outward,

as awful as that it's catchy, right?

Like people used to worry if
you, you know, before the,

during the time of the
Manhattan project, right?

If you, start this chain
reaction, you know,

will you blow the whole world up, right?

Or will it stop within this bomb or not?

And we see, okay, the
chain reaction of evil

hasn't yet blown the whole world up.

But look at how the catastrophe spreads.

And you think 50 to 60 million people dead

in the second World war
would truly was a world war,

what destruction was
spread around the globe.

- And that this is something
that can't be stopped

once the chain of reaction starts.

Like if Hitler was successful,

like he would just keep going.

- If he had been, think about if-

- On his personal
psychological level, I mean.

- Right 'cause if we think

from the perspective of destruction,

success would've led to
the need to conquer more,

then there's factions and infighting,

and then eventually you get

the same mass destruction, right?

And never does the
inaction of evil satisfy

what the person is initially seeking.

Like people wanna feel better
about themselves, right?

We like Wincott, who was
a British pediatrician

who wrote about children and adults

from very deep perspectives.

He wrote about the idea
of good enough, right?

And then you can sort of
extrapolate that to like,

we all wanna feel good enough,

like not just limp over
the line good enough,

but I wanna feel good enough
that I'm a decent person

in the world and like what I do matters.

And you know, I can have an
impact on people and you know,

people can like me and care about me.

There's a simplicity
there that people want,

that when people don't have,

and there's certain other factors,

maybe they're temperamental
factors or historical factors

can lead to trying to
soothe that deficit right?

Through envy and I think
it starts with that,

and it often starts in childhood,

not always, but it often
starts in childhood when

the child's brain and psychology
are so vulnerable and,

you know, you see salient
child abuse if, you know,

if you look at what
was Hitler's background

and what was Stalin's
background, and I mean,

you could look at almost
anyone who's perpetrated evil.

They're serial killers,
whatever it may be.

The majority, not everyone,

but the majority had these
lessons in childhood that said,

you're not good enough.

You can't keep yourself safe.

No one cares about you.

And in a subset of people
that's gonna generate envy

and that, you know,

that seed of evil then
gets planted and nurtured.

(jet engine roars)

Is a fighter jet roars above us.

- The sound of a fighter jet above us.

- It's been good. If I
had orchestrated that.

- You forget,

you quickly forget the comfort
of being in a peaceful place.

That's one thing I saw in Ukraine is, hey,

you quickly get comfortable here.

The whole trip back I
was thinking it's so good

to be in America, just a whole, like,

it's like a three day trip back.

It's so good to be American.

- We might take that for granted

as a population, but I do agree.

- So the destruction
never alleviates the envy.

Are all humans capable of envy?

- I believe the answer is yes.

If you think,

do we all have the
possibility of evil in us?

I think the answer to that is yes,

but we have free will, we have choice.

We can choose what we do with that.

Which is why just because
someone is a sociopath, you know,

for example, is doesn't mean
that they're not responsible.

I mean you know, our medical
legal jurisprudence, right?

Has absolutely borne that out.

That legally, medically we think, okay,

if we're responsible,
presuming we're healthy,

we're not unhealthy in
other ways that eliminates

our ability to be circumspect,

but that we're responsible for what we do

and don't nurture inside of us.

I mean, there are plenty of things

we could decide to nurture anger
and hatred about, you know,

I could think of slights difficulties,

whether it's something
someone else has done to me,

or I could blame fate or I could
be mad at God or the world.

We can all make those choices
and we're responsible for them

or we're recognizing things
in us that like, oh, I,

you know, I too have that in me,

but I don't wanna nurture that.

I don't wanna foster that.

Or do I choose to nurture and foster that?

And I think ultimately, you know,

a subject of Hitler as as evil,

if Hitler had kept winning
and winning, right?

I think ultimately he would've been

the only person on earth, right?

And I really do believe it.

Ultimately everyone,
everything else would be killed

because it's such destruction, right?

Destroy everything, right?

And probably when that didn't work,

then there's the destruction
of the self, right?

Because nothing soothes envy

that is stoked by the
sort of flames of evil.

And what you see is more and more anger

and more and more frustration,

which is why I really do
believe someone like that

who nurtured evil in themselves

that way ultimately would destroy,

there'd be like him and one other person

and then he'd kill the other person.

- I think that's really powerfully said.

But even just to return to
the jealousy versus envy,

I still think that it's the same flame

and envy's just the bigger version of it.

So I think I just,

in my own personal life, I've
felt jealousy towards others.

Like you said, like, oh, this
person has a, I don't know,

a cooler thing, trinket,
whatever trinket I cared about.

And usually it's when
somebody's really close

to the trinket you're building. (laughs)

And I, early on, like in my teens,

I realized that just empirically speaking,

that jealousy over a period of
a week just doesn't feel good

and it's not productive.

It doesn't help me build a better trinket

or it does if I turn it not into jealousy

towards another person,

but into a love for
building a better trinket.

It's like, oh cool, almost you know what,

like proactively speaking
and later in life,

like people like Joe
Rogan actually have been

really powerful in this for me,

just as a fan of his to
celebrate other people.

So it's almost as opposed to
ignoring that other person

with a cool trinket is like

celebrating their awesomeness in my mind.

Like just saying how awesome
the humans are able to do that.

And actually just how
awesome is that exact person

at being able to do that?

And that somehow made me more capable

to build my own trinket better.

And it feels good also.

Like it makes me feel happy.

- And now you're not jealous anymore.

- You're not jealous anymore.

- Right? That's why I think
jealousy is different, right?

Because you're saying there's
a week of jealousy, like,

I don't like this. Right?

I don't like, but if you
take that in a way that says,

wait a second, actually, this is awesome.

This is fabulous and this person did this,

that person's awesome, right?

Then you're not raining
on anyone's parade, right?

And in not doing that,
even inside your own mind

you gain a greater cognizance
of your own capability, right?

Well if he can do that or she can do that,

why can't I too, like I wanna build,

I wanna make the better
trinket too, right?

Now you're thinking
creatively, nowhere in there,

nowhere in there was
the emergence of evil.

- I just disagree with that.

I think there was a choice
made where I looked at

if my life was darker, more difficult,

I think it has nothing to do with

the actual little flame
of jealousy I felt.

I think it has to do a lot
more with the other context.

If my life were more difficult,

there was more abuse,
there was more challenges,

I think that decision,

I could have made that
decision a different direction.

Maybe. I don't know.

Yeah, you've written
brilliantly about trauma.

If there's a bit more trauma
as the background noise

of my decision making,

I'll be more likely to
not be able to pull away

from the gravitational
field of that jealousy.

It would build and build
and build and build.

So I think I,

not to disagree with a brilliant a person,

but like I feel like that flame,

that flame has the capacity
to engulf the whole world.

I guess the initial flame of jealousy,

the little bit like,
especially the younger you are,

it's almost like a habit that you get

to build in either direction.

Because I've early on
built a habit of saying

I'm going to channel that
jealousy into productivity

and into celebrating other people.

And that jealousy disappears.

That was like a little discovery for me.

I discovered that.

I get that doesn't come,
nobody tells that to you.

You kind of discovered that little thing.

I could have easily not discovered it.

I could have easily discovered that

it kind of feels good

to like mess with that
other person to like,

think shitty thoughts,
think negative thoughts,

do negative things to that other person.

'Cause that could also,

I just think the capacity in
that initial feeling is there.

And I think it's a decision
we make 'cause like otherwise,

I think it dissolves responsibility like,

well surely I'm not Hitler,

therefore this jealousy is normal.

No, I just feel like every jealousy

has the capacity to turn
into, maybe not Hitler,

but a toxicity that
destroys in a small way

in your own little private life.

But it could destroy.

- I agree that jealousy brings us...

Can bring us dangerously close to envy.

I mean maybe let's see if a heuristic

we could agree on, right?

Let's see.

So let's say, okay,

if we look at the terrain of
the mine as geography, right?

So if I'm feeling happy,
satisfied, proud, like

I'm pretty far from envy land, right?

But if I'm feeling jealousy now,

I'm coming kind of closer
to that border, right?

And I still, I think there's,

it's a big thing to go
over the border, right?

That the border isn't a gray area, right?

There's a border to go over.

And I think that you,

I agree com completely
one, certainly about trauma

that the more trauma there is,

because then the more
misunderstandings there are about self

and feelings that I'm not good enough.

And then that can be anger about why

and who might be oppressing me.

And you know,

I hate myself and everyone
else who seems to be better.

Like, so the trauma can drive us

in these negative directions,

but we're still crossing
over something, right?

So if you have the trinket,

and I think that's awesome, I want that,

I wanna work harder.

You know, what I could do though

is I could sneak in tonight
when no one's around

and I could move something around.

No, no way. I don't wanna do that, right?

But it's like, I came over
the border a little bit

and I thought maybe,

maybe that's a better way,
but then I came back, right?

And we are responsible for that, right?

Because it is a choice to
say, I don't wanna work hard,

I'm already working how hard.

I don't wanna make my trinket better.

I wanna think mine's the best
one. I could destroy yours.

Then, you know,

we're letting our mind go over that border

and do we say, run that forward, right?

Let's run that forward
and put people around us

who feel the same way and start doing it.

So we think less of ourselves
and we debase ourselves.

Do we run headlong in or do
we come over that boundary?

And that's maybe the
capacity for evil in us

that we come over that
boundary, all of us, right?

At times.

But do we come over it and then say, no,

that's not my choice.

That's not my self-definition.

And I'm coming back.

- But I'm trying to justify
maybe there's certain other

sociological forces that
help us cross the border too.

So in Nazi Germany, we've
been talking about Hitler,

but then there's also the German people.

And so maybe when there's
a bit of a mass hysteria,

so all these effects of like
combination of propaganda with

the small jealousies and
resentments of the people

that don't cross the
border, together they can

With great charismatic leaders
that sort of really fuel

that fire that we feel when
we're part of the crowd.

So maybe those individual kind
of psychological barriers,

we have to take that leap
from jealousy to envy.

Those can be made easier.

The leap can be catalyzed
through this massive.

- 100%. 100%.

I think that to me is a massive point.

We're talking about layers
of emergence, right?

So if there's individual consciousness,

then there's culture, right?

And you know, we're products
of the soup we swim in,

so to speak.

People would say that when
I was growing up, right?

We are products of the soup we swim in.

So if the soup that we're
swimming in is the soup of hatred.

Then it's gonna foster
all of those things.

So then you think about just

in a painting with a very broad brush,

the culture created in Germany
prior to the second world war

and like what was the
impact of the reparations

after the first world war, right?

Of the punishing
reparations impoverishment

and you know, and basically
humiliation, right?

That people were feeling okay.

Like there were a whole bunch
of decisions that impacted

that cultural perspective, right?

Then there must have been aspects,

just like I see in many ways parallels

in America now of what are our standards

for what we are communicating
to others, right?

How's the media deciding like

what's real and what's not real?

What's true, what's not true?

What's hatred that is only gonna do evil

versus what's hatred that's okay?

Because I might sell something

by putting it out there.

I mean that was,

we know that was going on in Germany

during the rise of the Nazis.

And I think there's a
parallel to, you know,

do we value truth?

Can we stand together and
say no matter how much

I might disagree with
you politically right,

we can still understand like that

there's right and there's wrong, right?

There's truth and there's lies, right?

So I think those are just two examples

of determinants of culture.

And then the culture is a
determinant of, you know,

is someone like Hitler
marginalized as like

that's a crazy evil person.

Oh my goodness. Like, whoa, right?

Or is that someone who
gains a greater following

and more adherence and then
there starts to be a momentum?

Because why? Because
what did demagogues do?

I think they have a giant lasso

and they harness the envy
of thousands upon thousands,

upon thousands of people.

That's right. You feel
worse about yourself too.

Doesn't matter what the reasons are.

Maybe it's your childhood, maybe it's not.

Maybe it's job failings,
maybe it's professional,

maybe it's personal, doesn't matter.

Like you have envy too,

let's put it together
and do some destruction

'cause that'll make us feel
better, which is a lie.

- So we've talked about envy.

Where does, from the leader perspective,

things like narcissism or sociopathy,

psychopathy come into play?

What can you make of the world we live in,

maybe the leaders that run the
world from the perspective,

from the lens of narcissism?

- So I am struck 20 years
of doing what I do now.

I've been a psychiatrist for
20 years and I practice in so

many different settings and I
consult in different settings.

I've been fortunate to have
a very wide purview of like

what's going on in people
and in the world around us.

And I am struck with amazement
that of all the things I see

that are, say, abnormal,

let's say from the mental
health perspective,

this could be depression, panic attacks,

hearing voices, addiction.

But there's so many things,

what cover everything that narcissism

is not frequent compared
to a lot of other things.

So it's small in terms of say,

narcissistic diagnosis, right?

It's much less than many other things,

but it causes the lion share.

I don't just mean the most
compared to anything else,

but I think more than 50%,
the majority of bad things,

evil things, destructive things

that I see in the world around us.

I think narcissists are wildly destructive

because they are driven completely.

They are lodged completely
in the lane of envy.

- Can you try to sneak up,

and we don't want to
be lost in definitions,

but can you try to sneak
up to a definition,

non-clinical definition of narcissism

that we're talking about?

- So narcissism is a deep,

pervasive and unquestioned
sense of inadequacy in the self

that comes along with anger
and fear and vulnerability,

fear of destruction,

fear of annihilation that is
compensated for by aggression,

by is it by the mechanics of envy,

by trying to make the self seem better

at the expense of others,
by taking from others,

by being completely cavalier

to the thoughts and feelings of others.

That narcissism is not arrogance.

Now narcissism is the
opposite of arrogance.

There is such a deep sense of
inadequacy and incompetence in

the self that the defensive
structure around that

becomes dominated by
like rocket fueled envy.

- So the machinery of narcissism is envy,

but what do you make of the
kind of more popularly discussed

kind of symptom of narcissism,

which is a seeming not
caring about other people,

sort of a very inward
facing focus in terms of the

calculation you make when making
decisions about the world.

- Well, narcissistic people

definitely care about other people, right?

It's people who are schizoid, right?

And say that don't care,

don't necessarily register
other people, right?

But narcissism people
care about other people,

but it's entirely
vis-a-vis the self, right?

If I'm schizoid,

I don't really notice or
care much who you are, right?

But if I'm narcissistic, I absolutely care

because I'm watching
every last detail of you,

what might you have that's
better than me, right?

It's an incredibly intense
focus upon individuals

and demographics of people.

But the priority, the goal
is entirely about the self,

which is why they then can become easy to,

so I don't care if a
million people die, right?

That's how different
is that from going out

and destroying one person
or a million people, right?

It's in the same category of those people.

Only their existence is only meaningful

in how it relates to me.

- But it's still meaningful.

It just seems like a very
difficult leap to take

that I don't care that
a million people die.

That seems to be, even with envy,

that seems to be a big like
feeling and thought to have,

if you at all care about
them, are other people,

I guess tools for

alleviation of your sense of inadequacy.

- I mean, I don't mean care about in that,

like being caring at all.

I mean caring about in that noticing

that a person exists, right?

I mean, someone who wants money

and notices that there's $100 bill out

cares about that, right?

They don't care about the $100 bill and

that doesn't mean anything to them.

It doesn't have thoughts and feelings,

but it's gonna attract attention.

They care about it because

it's something that they want, right?

The same way people
will care about others,

but only from the perspective of

do you have things that I want

or can I feel better about
myself by taking something

from you, by making things worse for you?

- People often talk about narcissism

as like the opposite of empathy,

but sort of empathy, again,
depends how you define it,

but it is a careful consideration

of the mental space of another person,

of how the other person sees the world.

And so you're kind of
saying that narcissism,

narcissistic people would
be also be very good at that

in order to understand
how maybe the other person

can be manipulated or something

to alleviate your sense of inadequacy.

- Right?

So there's a difference between
the mechanics of empathy.

So let's say, and we can
define things different ways.

So let's say empathic
attunement is the ability to be

attuned and to think, okay,
what's going on in you?

What might you be thinking?

What might you be feeling?

And some people have a lot
of empathic attunement,

but we could look at that
as mechanistic, right?

It doesn't equate to care, right?

An empathic attunement can come along

with empathy or not, right?

So yes, people who are narcissistic,

they can mentalize well,

so you mentalize meaning the ability

to understand or to
consider thoughts, feelings,

motivations in other people, right?

So people who are narcissistic
can have empathic attunement

or mentalization depending upon

how we wanna describe those things.

But that has nothing to do with care,

with actual empathy or
kindness or consideration.

- So in that sense,

empathy usually popularly
used means that you care,

like your happiness is aligned.

This is, I need to read this book

I've read so little science fiction,

that's been one of my goals for this year

to catch up on some science fiction.

So Robert Highland from
"Stranger in a Strange Land"

has this quote about love,

which is love is that condition where

another person's happiness
is essential to your own.

So that's a good definition, I guess,

of empathy where you're very sensitive,

so mechanistically very
sensitive to the state

of another person's mind and

your goal is to maximize their happiness.

It's like essential to your own happiness.

So the happiness are aligned
and one that's like elevated

to its highest forms,
you can call that love,

romantic love and friendship and so on.

Okay.

- Okay. So one more thing
about the narcissists.

Is some people can be
sort of benign narcissists

where they want great things
for themselves, right?

But if they have enough great things,

they can sort of tolerate
others being happy too.

And these are people who sometimes

are actually quite highly liked, right?

Because they have to have the most money,

the most power, the most of anything,

anything more than anyone
else could challenge.

But as long as I have that,

it's okay that you have some too, right?

And then that can make you
happy and can make you like me.

So benign narcissists can be well liked

from that perspective,

but it's still all about them.

And that can change if,

for example, there's a scarcity
of resources now, right?

But they're generally,

they're not people who are
being overtly destructive,

although that they're over
the border into the, you know,

into the envy territory, right?

Malignant narcissists
are very different where

they then want to have everything.

So even if I have a thousand
times more than you do,

I still envy you what you have.

Because I want to have,

I don't think I can feel
good enough about myself

unless I have everything.

And once I have everything,

I won't feel good enough
about myself either.

And then I don't have to have more, right?

It's like that's malignant
narcissism, which

we think of as sociopathy, right?

As again, we can define these
words in different ways,

but they're very, very negative concepts.

You know, that's profound sociopathy,

malignant narcissism, you
know, envy writ large.

- So sociopathy is malignant narcissism.

That's a convenient way to think about it.

- No, 'cause we can do sort
of sociopathic things that,

but not be sociopathic like.

Well, you know, the tell a white lie,

it's like sort of sociopathy
on steroids, right?

Is then, you know, envy writ
large is malignant narcissism.

- Well, just like you're saying, like,

there's empathic attunement, as you said.

So there's the mechanistic
aspect of empathy and sociopathy,

and then there's the big
label you get attached

if you're just doing that
thing regularly, I guess.

- Living your life through that lens.

Right. Yeah.

- And is there a spectrum
that's like narcissism,

sociopathy, and psychopathy?

Is it all the same kind of
nice stroll through the woods,

tow off the cliff, or not?

- Not really, because the words
don't have clear definitions

like psychopathy and sociopathy.

There's no real definition
of psychopath or psychopathy.

Does that mean someone's
sociopathic but psychotic?

Like, there's really not a,

we we end up using those
words colloquially, right?

Which is why, you know, concepts
that we can define like,

you know, like envy, empathic
attunement, narcissism,

even though there might
be nuances in definitions,

like we can define them in
ways that are widely accepted,

including within
psychology and psychiatry.

- So it's nice to just think
about this broad umbrella of

narcissism and the levels to
which it's benign or malignant.

And then also separating
into the different mechanisms

like interaction by interaction,

which sometimes can be narcissistic.

But broadly speaking,

do you do everything through
the lens of malignant

narcissism that makes
you a right sociopath

or a malignant narcissist?

- Yes and the thing I would add to that is

the thought about culture, right?

Is like, how does the cultures we're in,

whether it's the culture
of a household, right?

The culture of a community,

the culture of a nation
or the world, right?

How does that impact what
unfolds in that person?

And then how does what
unfolds in that person

impact that culture?

- Well, that's the question is
what unfolds in that person?

Yeah. How does culture affect it?

But how does your own psychological
development unfold that?

Because narcissism in leaders

is the most impactful thing, right?

Who are the most impactful individuals?

Well, what is the most impact
individual psychology we have?

It's usually leaders of countries

or leaders of major
organizations and so on.

And one of the things you
mentioned with benign narcissism,

it's, that seems to be
aligned with success, right?

If you care about your own
success, that's going to be,

you're more likely to be,
have narcissistic tendencies,

I suppose.

And so my question is,

when you follow that thread
of narcissism to become

the leader of a country,
now you have a lot of new,

interesting psychological
complexities to deal with,

like power.

That old cliche, that
power corrupts, does that,

is it possible for power
to corrupt the human mind

to where it pushes you farther and farther

into a malignant narcissism,
into this destructive envy?

What are your thoughts on power?

Like the effect of
power in the human mind?

- Yeah, I think power is
an accentuater, right?

An intensifier, right?

So, I think it is true that

there are people who can
be sort of in a gray area

where there are malignant narcissistic

tendencies and behaviors,

but they're also ways in which
that person can think outside

of themselves and think in a broader way

and think sort of kindly about others.

And they're sort of trying to navigate

whether they're aware or not

that they're trying to
navigate between one

and the other.

And then the allure of
power is, well just look,

just exercise that power and
you'll feel better, right?

You gonna, it'll show you
right, that you're good enough.

Look at the power you have and
whatever may be going on in

the person's mind that then
power yes, can corrupt.

Yes and I think that's why

we have to have checks
and balances, right?

Because we don't, you know,

we are all inscrutable to
ourselves, let alone to others.

So we must have checks and balances

and we should always
have them on ourselves

as well as on others.

We should want that for
the health of ourselves

and the world around us.

So I think all of that is true,

but there are also people
who don't necessarily

become corrupted by power, right?

There can be an
understanding and a grounding

that there a steward of power, right?

You know, a shepherd,
you know, the, I mean,

the ways people describe utilizing power

and utilizing it a benign way,

it in a benign way that then fosters

the healthy aspects of self, right?

So like gratitude and humility, right?

If, I mean,

if we could add a healthy
dose of gratitude and humility

to everyone or to our society,

there would be a sea change, right?

But how do you feel gratitude?

How do you feel humility?

Those things are incompatible
with narcissism envy, right?

With the really the bad poll of things

that we're talking about.

And part of the reason I, you know,

I'm so focused in my work and
in really what runs through

all of my thoughts about life is that

the impact of trauma, right?

Because trauma, you know,

creates these false lessons
and it walls us off from truth.

And you know, it starts to point towards

the unhealthy ways of trying
to feel better about ourselves.

But we have the health in us too.

We have those seeds of health too

that can grow into
being a steward of power

and sharing power and
being considerate and kind.

And we see a lot of that
in the world too, right?

It's not all just the evil.

We, you know,

we see plenty of people who do good

and who are generous
of spirit and you know,

we have both in us.

And it is,

I think you're talking about our culture

and what the seeds that we sow
and the climate that we set,

including putting governors
and boundaries around,

like how do we reign in or
say that the more aggressive,

the more envious or destructive
is unacceptable, right?

How do we foster the part that's kind

and considerate and reflective
and slow to judge of like,

hey, let's learn a little bit more.

Like how do we foster that?

And I think a lot of that comes back

to early childhood education.

I mean, I think we don't do nearly enough

to protect children.

And as a corollary to that
we don't do nearly enough

to educate children.

And we said, I wanna write a book,

second book I write

is gonna be everything I
needed to know about life

I learned as a second year
postgraduate psychiatry resident.

It's like, why?

You know,

why then did I learn so much
about unconscious motivation,

about the impact of trauma,

about how we can be envious
and how we can act out,

you know, even about how our
emotions trump logic in us.

Like why don't we teach these things

when we're young enough
to understand like,

why is that other kid bullying me, right?

Or why, just because
I'm a little bit bigger,

do I want to go thump that
other kid on the head?

Like, what's going on that we don't,

we don't do those things,
you know, we're just,

we're tripping a ahead of ourselves

and we don't stop and think

how are we using our resources?

How are we shepherding
forward the next generation?

Which by the way is a generation

that's gonna determine
our fates too, right?

As we get older. But we
don't, you know, do that.

I often think of like in
the Olympics, you know,

you see like this great sprinters, right?

And they've gotta come outta
the blocks perfectly, right?

'Cause if they come outta the
blocks a little bit too fast,

they're gonna fall over, right?

They're gonna just fall forward.

And I often see that in my
head about us as, you know,

as humans and as a culture that

we're rushing so far forward.

We don't stop and say, wait,
let's keep the basics here.

The basic techniques of like,

how are we navigating forward in life?

Or do we just throw all those away?

Because I can get some benefit
by saying that you are bad,

even though what's being leveled

against you is wrong, right?

Like, why, do I take that or do I say,

no, there's something more important here

that we wanna shepherd forward
in ourselves as a culture.

And I think preventing childhood
trauma and changing the

ways that we educate children
and adults could again,

make a sea change and maybe
set us on a course towards,

you know, even towards a
greater likelihood of survival

as a species.

- Yeah, so talking to like people

in elementary school about
human nature and teaching them

was so how people can be
resentful and envious and

how to deal with your
emotions, how to, yeah.

These basic interaction things
about human relationships,

about friendships, about
betrayal, about love,

about all those things.

Like, it just, it is sexually
strange that we don't,

we kind of hope the parents talk

about that kind of stuff.

But then the parents often, you know,

need therapy themselves.

- The parents that didn't learn it, right?

I mean, yeah, I'm not joking that I was,

I was mad, you know, second
year after medical school.

Like how is it, like,

I think of even things in my
own life and you know, how I,

you know, like how much shame I felt

after my brother's suicide.

Like I was already an adult, right?

I was a young adult, but
I felt so much shame.

I didn't, like, I had no
understanding that, oh,

like it's a reflex to trauma, right?

To feel guilt and shame.

And that of course,

I was feeling that it
didn't mean it was true

because I felt it,

but I mapped the fact that I
felt ashamed to the fact that

I should have felt guilty and ashamed

and like led to some very
negative things in my life

that I had to sort of
pull myself back from

and recover from.

And like, I didn't know that, right?

I didn't know the
automaticity of the reflex

and how pervasive it can be

and how it can put blinders on us.

And I mean, it's just one
example, but you know,

it's an example of something
big that could happens

to people that we don't learn about.

And I find myself sometimes
having conversations

with a person.

So, you know, I still do
a lot of clinical care

of having conversations with
a person after a tragedy.

And I'm saying, I can't believe, right?

Again, I'm saying the things that

this person didn't learn
in elementary school

because like none of us did, right?

And then look at the
misery and the suffering.

And then I think this is one person among

how many millions among us who, you know,

who try and go about their
way without knowing things

that are easily knowable
'cause they don't even know

that they're knowable

because we don't teach them to ourselves.

- So how to deal with trauma,

that trauma happens first of
all, that suffering can happen,

and small trauma and big
trauma, all of it can happen.

And there's natural ways to deal with it.

So in the case of traumas you write about,

and we can also just talk about some more

of the details of that but,

it's good to bring it to the
surface to talk about it,

to not be ashamed to hide it inside.

To be some kind of secret
that it's actually, I mean,

there's a lot of positive
things to say here,

at least from my perspective.

One is it's discussing trauma
and dealing with trauma

together with other human
beings by talking about it.

There's a path to deep
friendship and intimacy

with those people.

There's a dark aspect to trauma,

to war that communicating
it or sharing it bonds you.

So like the other side of trauma is like,

love, is you need that
hardship, not you don't need it,

but hardship and trauma
can often be a catalyst

for a deep human
connection if you bring it

to the surface as opposed to
kind of hide it on the inside.

If we can just linger on it,

because you've been through a
few very traumatic events in

your life when you were 25 years old,

as you mentioned your
brother committed suicide.

What did that event teach
you about life, about death,

and about the human mind?

- What certainly brought me face to face

with the truths of life and death,

because I had not had a
major trauma before then.

So there wasn't a major trauma sort of

in my developmental years that what

can carry forward is a sort
of omnipotence defense, right?

I mean, the thought is
that when we're toddlers,

we all have like an omnipotence
defense, which is like,

I can just try and get up and run

and move and if I run into something,

I'll get up and do it again, right?

That we, you know, we kind of have to,

and it's partly the protection
of the parent, et cetera.

But we think we can get
out there in the world

and do things and we just do.

And if we don't have major traumas,

we can sort of carry through the, oh,

like bad things aren't gonna happen to me.

You know, like they,

I know that they're there and
I know they happen to people,

but they're not, don't
happen to me, right?

And sometimes what will
happen is being confronted

with such a tragedy wipes
that away very, very quickly.

And then that person
feels extremely exposed.

Like, oh, I thought that like

I was gonna be okay and
now I know that I'm not.

And then, and that can start to lead to,

and what does that mean?

And now is this all coming for me?

Now, you know, is did I
get so lucky for 25 years,

nothing bad happened

now nothing but bad things
are gonna be happening.

Am I cursed? Is my family cursed?

Right? And I think that
leads to, you say what?

The learning about the
human mind in retrospect,

I think I understood at
the time to some degree,

but not like I do now, I can
put words to it now, right?

Of like how incredibly
important, powerful,

powerfully important
negative emotion is, right?

That how a sense of guilt
and shame and vulnerability

can just pervade our
entire life perspective.

So all of a sudden we're
swimming in a very different soup

and it's a frightening
soup and it's a toxic soup.

And I'm most struck by that.

And that goes along
with the idea that like,

we're not taught that
emotion always beats logic.

You know, like I think the
idea of decar and, you know,

the idea that we're rational
creatures, you know,

that kind of comes down to
us through western thought

is like completely not true.

Like we're rational creatures.

Only if there is an emotion

grabbing for our attention, right?

Like, you know, we're
attending to one another,

we're being very logical, right?

What we're doing now,

if we heard a frightening
noise right outside the door,

like we'd be entirely different, right?

The emotion would trump
everything and say,

stop paying attention to this, right?

Safety is at stake and
we think differently,

feel differently, behave
differently, right?

And this is what happens to us,

not just in situations
where something drags us

from one yanks from one
emotional state to another,

but it can be very, very pervasive.

So my sense of anger,
frustration, inadequacy,

and then soothing in
unhealthy ways, you know,

soothing by drinking too much
and then kind of hating myself

in the first place and and
hating the world around me.

And then, you know, starting
to think, well, who cares?

You know what happens?

Like, you know, there's
some very dark thoughts

and choices that came from

a changed perspective
of self in the world.

- So what do you do in that
because of trauma, again,

small or large,

you find yourself swimming

or drowning in a soup of negative emotion.

What do you do?

What do you do with that emotion?

I mean, we don't have to
even talk about trauma is,

I think the interesting
thing is, you know,

any one of us throughout
the day can find ourselves

taking a bit of a dip in the
pool of negative emotion.

What do we do with that?

- The first thing is
to separate how we feel

from what's true.

'Cause we don't do a good
job of that as humans.

If I feel bad about myself,

it's very easy to then I
conclude like I'm bad, right?

If I feel ashamed of myself,

I conclude I'm a terrible
person who's shameful, right?

This is a, you know,

there's an old psychodynamic concept of

what they used to call it,

an observing ego still gets called that,

it's not ego in the sense
of arrogance, right?

It's the ability to step outside

and to to see ourselves, right?

So that's what lets us keep the difference

between our feelings, right?

And what we know to be true.

Like we could be very angry at someone.

And so I think that person's terrible.

I think that person's stupid.

I think that right now because
like something negative

just passed between us, this inside of me,

it's just because of how I feel like

when I can separate that,

how do I actually think
about that person, right?

And you know, we get driven so,

so frequently by how we feel

because how we think therefore
what we believe, right?

Just kind of comes on its
heels as if the feeling

is dragging it along.

And I've been struck by that.

It's one of the things that has struck me,

so the most, right?

Among the very most in 20 years

of working as a psychiatrist,
is how we are led by

our feelings, our emotions,
as if they are truth.

And then they create
truth because we embrace

what they're telling us as true.

And that is I think, incredibly,

I think it's how people learn prejudice.

I think it's how people learn self-hatred.

I think it's how we learn so
many destructive behaviors.

And then the blinders on us come in

more and more and more and more.

So separate, you know,

we we're driven by what we
feel unless we understand that

what we feel is different
from what we know to be true

or what we can decide
on one way or another.

- And that requires realizing and catching

the emotions themselves,
realizing that it's an emotion,

a feeling comes into
your mind, overtakes you,

a feeling of anger, dislike,
hatred, all of that.

It just comes in.

It's like, why did that person
just cut me off in traffic?

Or something like that, that feeling.

So what you just kind of take
it as a feeling and realize

it's a feeling that doesn't
represent some deep reality

about the world.

That's fundamental. Or you.

That you just kind of
watch it and let it pass,

which is the natural way of things.

- Yeah. Or decide if it means anything.

You know, if I mad right?

Someone cut me off and I feel hatred

and I wanna destroy them, right?

To stop and think, look,
I've got that in me.

I can, you know,

are the stressors running
too high in my life?

Like, is it really good?

Should I be on this road
10 minutes behind schedule?

Like, is it, what am I really doing?

So we can learn.

But yes, it's an observation skill, right?

And it's an observation
skill that we can develop.

You know, I often think of it,

there's something called
the tapestry theory,

which I think initially was
a, the odyssey of explaining,

I believe this is true,
I'm not sure of this,

but the idea was that, oh,

we don't see God's plan because

we're up too close to it, right?

Like, as if there was a
beautiful tapestry on the wall

and we're standing right up it,

we're only gonna see one part of it.

We need to stand back from it.

And you know,

I remember learning that religion
studies class being really

fascinated with that at the time.

And I think that there are a lot of things

we do that about, right?

And in training ourselves
to have an observing ego,

what we're saying is, hey, like the, just

the busyness of life or my own impulses

or the pool of emotions are
trying to pull me up right close

to whatever tapestry there is there.

And I wanna sort of resist that.

I mean, I'm better off

if I really stay further behind it

and then I make a choice if
I wanna to come close to it.

If there's some really positive emotion,

it's friendship or it's love
or it's nurturing, whatever,

you know what, let me come
right up to this, right?

But I wanna choose when I'm doing that,

I don't want some drive.

I didn't decide to like,

take me by the back of the head and

put me up against that tapestry.

- So the interesting exercise for me,

and I think for a lot of people
in modern civilization is

the internet with social media that it is,

it's almost like going to the
gym or something like that.

At least that's the way I see it.

Because there's a bunch
of forces on social media

that are trying to make you feel things.

Most of it is kind of in the
negative space of feelings

because there is actually
a strong gravity pull

to negative feelings for some reason.

And the brain notices them more.

I don't know what that pull is,

but it's there and you get to
observe it on social media.

Like if you actually just
scroll through social media,

you feel the gravitational
pull of negative emotions.

And I just see as a kind
of exercise of like,

you feel the pool, just
like when you go to the gym,

there's a resistance and I
practice like stepping away

to look at the tapestry, right?

And there's different mechanisms

I think all of us have to learn.

For me, there's a kind of,

you mentioned gratitude and humility.

So like if somebody is,
if it's me personally,

I've recently gotten attacked
a few places here and there,

you know, if they're saying that

they're much smarter than me,

I practice kind of humility
like you mentioned,

and I kind of imagine that
they are smarter than me.

Those things like help me
to kind of like pull away.

Like, and then maybe they
have a lesson to teach me.

Like I don't take their sort of

negative comments to heart.

But I imagine the human
being and like that

they might have a lesson to teach me.

And in general,

when it's more amorphous
kind of negative feeling,

I'll think the other
thing is the gratitude.

Just like different versions,

almost meme-fiable versions of like,

oh, this is pretty cool.

Like, we got a thing going here.

There's like human
civilization like bickering

and having a little fun
like lunch, food fight.

And then it's kind of cool, like,

we get to interact in this way
and there's a bit of humor.

There's, it's like Thanksgiving dinner,

like if you like, Thanksgiving dinner,

if you're arguing about politics,

it can feel like really intense.

Like, I can't believe you said
this, but if you zoom out,

it's like family, this
is like, this is amazing.

And so that kind of feeling really helps.

And, but it's like, it really
is like going to the gym,

it's like building up a muscle.

To be able to pull away
from those emotions.

I don't think I get to
practice that kind of

emotion regular day-to-day
life 'cause like, you can't,

it's hard to get those
reps on social media.

You could really get the
reps in. It's kind of cool.

Like that's the way

I see social media is a
chance to sort of practice

that stoicism of like, of
gratitude, of humility,

of loving other people in the face

of this negative emotion, all that.

- Yes and you know,

there's a certain kind of psychotherapy

that talks a lot about
this idea that like, oh,

everything is as it should be, right?

Which doesn't mean from
some moral or justice point,

it's just that often
if you look at things,

one thing leads to another, to another,

to another in a way that's
actually very, very predictable,

even though we might be
surprised about it, right?

And so an example,

so I would say that gratitude
often does come along

with a healthy pride, right?

So you could say in the example you gave,

Hey, I'm being assailed
on social media. Okay?

So you could say, well, you
know, there was a time I sat at,

I set forth to impact people, right?

To be able to reach people
and to impact them, right?

And look,

I feel a sense of both gratitude and pride

that I've done that, right?

Because look, you did it

because of your effort, right?

Your work, your
intelligence, your thoughts,

like you're responsible for it, right?

But also you feel gratitude
because any one of us who's here

and has any opportunity,

has reason to feel
immense gratitude, right?

So then you can say, okay,
what's actually going on here?

Is something successful
I set out to do something

and I'm doing it right?

And what it brings with it

absolutely includes being assailed.

There's no surprise there, right?

That because of, because you know,

people who have anything good

serve as lightning rods for envy.

So then yes, there will be
people who wanna make up lies

or whatever they wanna do

because you become a
lightning rod for envy

by having succeeded at the
thing you set out to do

about which you can feel

a healthy pride and gratitude, right?

And then I think that kind
of puts it in its place.

I mean, you're still gonna
make decisions about it,

but it makes sense then like

you have a mechanism of understanding it

that not only makes sense to you,

but reflects the truth of
what you actually have done

and achieved and what's going
on in the world around you.

- Well, I wonder if we're all
kind of a little bit unique

in this, because for me,

I mean maybe it's useful
to kind of talk through

my own experience of it
is for me, I try to avoid,

especially in those situations,

to feel pride because I'm
just looking empirically.

I feel way happier if I focus on humility.

If I ever think of
like, oh yeah, you know,

when you do something meaningful
or you become more popular,

you're going to experience these kinds of,

I feel the attacks more.

And it's like me versus the world.

That's the feeling that you start getting.

And that does not create
a pleasant feeling.

So to me, the pleasant
feeling is like stepping away,

like kind of laughing at it all.

Like with a, with a smile
and not like in a negative,

like laughing at people,
but just like laughing at

the theater of it, the circus of it.

Like this whole absurd
existence we've got going on.

And then just having a humility in like,

everybody has a lesson to teach me.

It just makes me feel good.

The pride thing I do like feeling when

in a positive pool of emotion.

So if I'm building a
trinket and I finish it,

I'm like really happy with myself.

Like I finished this thing

and I usually actually
like to do that alone.

Like, I don't need an audience for pride.

I like to sit there and just
like, Ooh, this is cool.

I did that, you know, but I just,

I find that in social interactions,
pride is just a danger.

It is a dangerous drug
for me because it, like,

it's such a small,

it's a small step away from
then losing all the humility

and then you start getting very defensive.

And that's not going to, that's just,

it starts you on a spiral
of negative emotion.

But I also, I mean with everybody,

you've mentioned this will
probably sneak up to it

in different directions.

I do think there's different
brains that we all have.

Like my brain is exceptionally
self-critical. Like nonstop.

It's like a, it's like an
engine that's always there and,

but at the same time you're,

I'm able to zoom out and
have gratitude and it just,

it's as just, there's like two brains

and they're like cohabitating happily.

And I can, the better I get at this,

the more I can use the
one that's self-critical

when I'm trying to be productive.

'Cause naturally I'm super lazy.

So I'm trying not to be less lazy.

I'll be self-critical.

And then when I'm not
being lazy, when I just,

there's a special moment I
want to enjoy that moment.

I'll turn on the gratitude engine.

I feel like generic advice
that people would give,

if your brain is self-critical,
that's not a good thing.

Like you should probably get rid of that.

I don't know about that.

'Cause it seems to be working little bit.

Not like, I kind of like it,

I kind of like this grumpy old man

that's in there that's like,

that thing you did that really sucked.

Like, I was like, and I kind of, you know,

there's a movie "Grumpy old man".

Like I like, that grumpy...

The grumpy cat is in there and it's nice.

But yeah, it can have bad
effects on relationships

and on maybe my wellbeing,

maybe as you get older and
all that kind of stuff.

So you have to monitor
all this kind of stuff.

But I don't know, I don't
know which one it's like,

'cause you've kind of highlighted,

it's good to have gratitude and humility,

but it's also good to have
a little bit of pride.

I wonder what that like, set
of ingredients for healthy,

what like healthy life
looks like for each of us.

Whether we have to customize
and figure out what that is.

'Cause some of the cake is
already baked is the problem.

And because of the trauma,

like if I was like eight years old,

maybe I could be a little more flexible.

But at this point,

like you got the thing you got

and it's hard to, like, you fix it.

- You could do a lot with it.

- You could.
- It may not be easy,

but there's a lot of plasticity

and a lot of pliability there.

- Across all ages.

- Again, people are different

and there may be idiosyncrasies of why

one person is in a different place,

but as a general rule, I think
the answer is absolutely yes.

I mean, people have evolved

and I've worked with people
who've really changed themselves

and broadened their conception
and understanding, you know,

they're in their eighties or you know,

I think we can do it at any stage of life.

And I would make a case for intrapsychic.

So not between people necessarily, right?

But inside of oneself
for the feeling of pride.

And maybe if we call
it self-esteem, right?

Like let's say we call
it self-esteem, right?

Or we could call it healthy pride.

We could put either word to it.

But if you think about
what we're trying to avoid

is say a sense of inadequacy,

then it is good to sort
of own what's ours.

We can put ourselves a
little bit out of balance

either in terms of building up resentments

or in terms of decreasing
self-confidence, right?

If we're not owning
everything that's ours, right?

So a thought I would have
about let's say about

some pride or some self-esteem, right?

Is it can work against
vulnerability, right?

Which we know can also in some
situations push us towards

jumping the boundary into
envy and all of that.

So think about vulnerability.

If you conceive, okay,
people are assailing me,

and you just go to a place
of gratitude, you know,

it can send a message that, okay,

I'm just lucky and I hope
I continue to get lucky

as opposed to like,
that's not true, right?

Like there's ability inside of me

and discernment inside of me that tells me

I can have a greater sense of confidence

that I'll navigate what
comes my way, right?

So because the pride
or the self-esteem part

is owning what we've contributed

to the goodness we've created, right?

Which does in a sense helps us
feel better about ourselves.

And it also helps us feel armed again,

say the slings and arrows of, you know,

whatever outrageous fortune may come next.

- I don't know. I don't know.

I don't know. Again,
disagreeing with an expert here.

Yes. I think that's generally good advice.

But I think you mentioned vulnerability.

I think it's like,

I've just been doing a lot of research

on rocket engines and rock fuel.

Speaking of fuel, I just think I get a lot

from being vulnerable because vulnerable

leads to intimacy in
friendships and relationships.

I get a lot from being intimately
close with human beings

just on a friendship on a,

like a ideal level in
conversations and so on.

And so I would rather err on
the side of vulnerability.

Like to me, pride is destructive.

I think I already, yeah,

I already have a pretty
good engine that says like,

life is awesome, I don't
need help for that.

That's fine. That one is working.

I just feel like the way to
face the world that's full

of uncertainty that
could be full of cruelty

is with humility and gratitude.

I don't know, this pride thing.

It feels like I know
that for a lot of people,

it's really important to really,

really work on pride to make
sure they don't crumble under

the pressure of like

they don't give into the
insecurity that destroys them.

But I just, for me, I,
empirically speaking,

I seem to be happier facing the world

with humility and just being grateful.

The pride, I'm really worried about that.

Like, I just, it feels more
destructive than anything.

- See what I think as
you're telling me that

in order to be presumptuous,

but I make some thoughts or
some conclusions that tell me,

Hey, you're in a pretty
healthy place, right?

And the reason I say that is

because I agree completely
about vulnerability.

I mean, think about humility

and gratitude make us vulnerable, right?

If you're like, wow,
I'm grateful, thank you,

I'm grateful for you, you know,

we could get shot down
or something, you know,

something bad could
happen and something could

make us feel bad.

So yes, we need vulnerability.

If we try and eliminate vulnerability,

we're living miles into the
envy, you know, land, right?

So you're describing a
healthy vulnerability.

But then my brain says that's because

on the other side of
the seesaw, so to speak,

has to be a healthy sense of self,

whether we call it
self-esteem or healthy pride.

And then I'll cite what I
think is the evidence for that

is you described the
negative voice, right?

As like the grumpy cat, right?

But that's a good negative
voice to have, right?

Because it's telling you like,
Hey, that wasn't your best.

Like, come on, do better or right?

Like you can do better.

Like there's, you know,

there's a negative voice in some ways,

but it believes in you.

It's it where that voice could be,

it could be a negative voice that says

you didn't do that well because you suck.

You don't deserve anything good, right?

Why should you even be alive, right?

I mean, like, that's the negative voice.

That gain, you know,

that can gain so much force
if there isn't a balance

of healthy self-esteem.

So I think because you're
well-balanced, you know,

you have what you need,

and then having more of it seems like, oh,

that's not so good,

but their people whose negative
voice isn't the grumpy cat,

it's hateful, right?

And then that's a person who needs

to bring that into greater balance.

- Yeah, I think my negative
voice is like a grumpy cat

that's like a French existentialist,

maybe a little bit of an
nihilists, but just kind of.

- Is a Sagittarius cat.

- Yeah. Sagittarius cat.

So it doesn't get hateful.

It's not like a Hitler
cat, so it's just a little,

it's a little more, yeah,

I guess there is kind of like this line

that we've come across a couple of times

between the benign and the malignant.

But of course you have
to monitor that line.

I just, I think you have to be careful

when you face really
difficult situations of,

as you've gone through life
more and more difficult,

you face a lot of loss and suffering,

especially later in life.

You have to be careful with that voice

that grumpy cat can get awfully confident.

And then if you don't have any
source of positive emotions

in your life, you can become
too heavy of a burden.

- Yes, which I think
this leads us to a, well,

I think it's a really
important fact, right?

That there are some people,

like a significant subset of people

who get happier as they get older.

They have more contentment,
a stronger sense of self.

You may think, how could
that ever happen, right?

Like, we're getting closer to death,

we're accumulating insults, right?

Like, and everything
hurts a little bit more

and we have less energy

and we accumulate losses and traumas.

Why would anyone be healthier across time,

feel happier across time?

And what we see is it's
linked to the good,

to the things that we're
talking about, right?

It's linked to say, let's say
vulnerability versus pride.

Like there's a good balance there, right?

There's a lot of humility,
there's a lot of self-esteem.

The person is spending a lot of time

standing back from the tapestry
and looking at it, right?

And what can come into people

is in sort of a sense of equanimity.

Like, I sort of understand, you know,

I'm being the best person I can be.

I'm, you know, and that's
not always even great.

And there are things that
I don't feel great about

even while I'm trying to do that.

But, but look, I'm being who
I'm choosing to be, right?

And that doesn't have
to be in some big way.

I'm not saying that means any
one specific thing, you know,

that can mean the person
who's taking care of their cat

and tending their garden.

Like, that's enough.

We have to have the, you know,

love the ability to put good
things out in the world, right?

And to put our our ability to work and be,

to make things different
out into the world

and make things better.

And if we're doing that,
we get happier across time.

Because we come to a sense
of peace with ourselves.

I'm not supposed to be everything.

I'm not supposed to do everything.

I'm not supposed to fix everything, right?

I'm also not supposed
to suffer all the time

for the things I haven't gotten right.

You know what, I guess I'm kind of,

and it leads back to Wincott, right?

The British physician of, I'm, you know,

I'm good enough.

And that seems to help
people feel happy, you know,

contentment and be generative

and productive into later life.

It's like, that's what
we all should be wanting.

But it's even, it's kind
of an afterthought though.

Some people are like that as opposed to,

wait a second, right?

Like, what's going on with them?

And let's do all of that.

- Albert Camus writes a mythicist quote,

"There's only one real
serious philosophical problem,

and that is suicide.

Deciding whether or not
life is worth living

is to answer the fundamental
question in philosophy.

All other questions follow from that.

So basically to be or not to be."

Do you think there's a
truth to that statement?

This question of why live at all?

Do you think there's truth
to that statement being

a really, really important
question for us to answer?

- Yes.

Yes.

- And what's the answer?

- I think the answer is yes,
and I think Camus answered it.

Yes, too.

You know, I love his writing and you know,

I think there was a streak of nihilism

that I think grew in his
writing over the years.

And the thought is,

I think that Camus died by suicide.

I think we're not sure of that

because it was a car accident.

But I've always read that as

this the primary scholarly opinion.

And I think it's interesting
that after his death,

a book called "The First
Man" was published,

which I don't know if he
had intended to publish,

I don't remember the specifics about it,

but it's about him as a child, right?

And it's interesting, the first man,

even he was the first man
in his existence, right?

The most, you know,

the one that felt and
experienced everything

and there's sadness and
distress and all in that book.

But there's a beauty of life
and living and experience.

And I think to compare that
beauty, like that's life.

Even if something's
difficult and scary and sad,

like there's something
beautiful around the corner

and here's a kind person and
a new discovery, you know,

more what was in him as a child.

And I think that we can get jaded as we,

as you and I were just talking
about a few minutes ago.

We can accentuate the negative
and foster the negative

and come to a place where
we're looking for some

in-depth philosophical answer, you know,

some thick book, you know,

that's gonna explain all that to us

instead of the simplicity
that we've been talking about.

I think humility,

gratitude helps us have just
simple positive experiences,

feelings of contentment,

feelings of connection
with another person,

learning, discovery.

And I think the answer
to Camus question is yes.

And I think it lies in his writing about

when he was a child,

which I think he saw as less important

than his later writings and
the intellectual heaviness

when I think maybe he had
lost his way a little bit

from the things he understood
when he was younger.

- So another way to talk about it,

and I'd love to hear what you think is

about these broad categories.

Let me be started with
Kikiguard of existentialism,

absurdism and nihilism.

And I think Camus considered
himself an absurdist,

not actually an existentialist.

It's kind of a middle ground
where I think existentialist,

I don't wanna characterize
it in the wrong way,

and there's a lot of
different definitions,

but I think existentialists
ultimately do think that there

is meaning in sort of
pursuing the passion of life,

like pursuing the, like
in living life there.

That's where you discover the
meaning at that individual

level of fully embracing life.

And I think sort of nihilism is, again,

it's kind of like a spectrum,

but nihilism basically
says there's no meaning.

And it doesn't matter, nothing matters.

I don't even know.

But somehow that lands you in a place

that's totally uninspired.

Maybe nihilists would disagree with that.

Maybe there is a way
to live a creative life

in a nihilistic mindset.

And I think absurdism is
somewhere in the middle

where pursuing meaning at
all is not a good idea.

So kind of,

I think existentially say you
should be looking for meaning,

and it's to be discovered
in your own actions,

in your own life, in the moment.

And absurdism says, life is
absurd, nothing makes sense.

Don't look for the meaning. Just live.

Just be.

I think that's kinda the later
Camus kind of philosophy.

I don't know if you can sort of comment

on these kind of nuanced ideas here.

If there is no religious
guide to your life,

what do you think about this
kind of search for meaning?

Do you see that there's some wisdom

in the existentialist
perspective of discovering it

in your own life, in this passion,

in this kind of day-to-day existence,

in the moments of your
life that bring you joy,

that kind of thing?

- You're bringing different
sort of perspectives

and trying to tease
apart, like, well wait,

what are the differences in
those perspectives, right?

And I think what it
points out is that, okay,

we tend to conflate things
as human beings, right?

And to take two different things

and try and make them into one.

But we also, I think on the
other end of the spectrum,

get very overly reductionist.

And I think that when we
get to overly reductionist,

we lose the ability to learn from anything

or to generate meaning, right?

I mean, the thing about
Sartre who is, you know,

the thought of existentialism

is so consistent with him, right?

Who on the one hand, you
know, wrote about, you know,

very clear terms,

like this is what it is
and this is what it isn't,

and here's how you're
gonna make your meaning

in a very like,
academically prescribed way.

But he also wrote short
stories like "The Wall", right?

Where there's something
totally absurd happens, right?

As part of the story, right?

So I think what ends
up happening is people

either reduce themselves or
get associated with something

that is by being overly reductionist

takes us away from meaning, right?

The idea that, look, we
don't know if there is

an overarching religious
meaning or you know,

what we call a religious
meaning or purpose.

Like we don't know that, right?

So, okay, if we take that as a given,

that people who say that
they know are having faith,

like how Spinoza described faith, right?

Faith is that you don't know,
but you believe anyway, right?

It's not because you have faith,

now you know something, right?

Because I think that's a slippery slope

to the persecution of others, right?

So if we say, okay, we
don't know, then, you know,

we're left either deciding, okay,

well then the hell with
everything, you know,

like there's that movie, "A
Strange Brew" right there,

Bob and Doug Mackenzie, where like

the brakes don't work on the
car and one of them says, oh,

why bother steering, right?

So if we don't know that there's meaning

like why bother steering,

let's just give up the ghost, right?

And I don't think that's
even what the nihilists said.

I mean, I think the Koonin said

we should get rid of everything that

we've ever created except
Beethoven's ninth Symphony

and start over from there.

So even people who are very nihilistic

or associated with that,

a lot of 'em were just not
liking what we had built, right?

So if we accept that a
lot of what we have built

as humans inside of us and outside of us

is really counterproductive
and doesn't help us,

and that absurd things
happen in the world, right?

And that often the way social structures

and systems build themselves up is absurd.

Like I think our
healthcare system operates

in a way that's absurd, right?

So if we accept that there are absurdities

that we don't know, if there's truth,

then what are we left with?

But like, well, let's try
and make meaning, right?

Ortega said, (speaking foreign language)

I'm myself and my circumstances, right?

Which is like, look, we
can't control everything.

We live in circumstances around us,

but within those circumstances
we can make decisions

and define ourselves.

And I think the brilliance of that,

and I think tying it all together, right,

in a way that's not trying to be in sense,

it ties it all together by not trying

to answer everything concisely.

That yes, we can make meaning.

Like we see that if someone
trips in front of me,

I could walk around them
or I could help them up.

I mean, no one can tell me that

it doesn't matter what I do.

I absolutely reject the idea that oh,

I could step over them or on them

or I could help them up
and it doesn't matter.

Oh yeah, try being the
person on the ground, right?

So we create meaning,

but we live in our circumstances
and there are absurdities

both within us and outside of
us in our social structures.

And there are a lot of things

that pretend to have meaning that don't.

And there's the shades of nihilism,

but ultimately there's something
going on here that's doing

the best we can in the
context of just not knowing.

- Yeah, I tend to see, I
don't know if it's genetic,

I think I tend to think
just observing the internet,

the number of memes there are,

I think many other people are like me.

I tend to see the humor and the absurdity.

I tend to enjoy it from
that kind of angle.

I see the KKK nature of society,

of different aspects of society
and just kind of notice the

magic with a smile and just
laugh at the circus of it all.

'Cause there it is magical that

the circus all comes together.

It's like a little bit
outta sync and then this is

a guy playing trombone, but
like overall it's pretty good.

It's pretty good.

- Right, and we can look at that

and just kind of marvel and go huh, right?

Which I think is a relation
to at least a lot of

what we in the western world
think of as Eastern, right?

It's like as non-attachment, right?

Because then if there's something absurd

and it's like not good
for me, you know, right?

Then I accept that too instead
of getting angry about it and

railing about it or seeing some
cosmic meaning in it, right?

I think there's also a
healthy non-attachment

in what you're saying too.

- So there's,

I mean you mentioned Eastern
thought there's the Escherichia

but also Buddha have kind of
spoke of life as suffering.

Do you think there's truth
to that, that suffering

is a fundamental part of life?

- I think it is a
fundamental part of life.

I don't think that means that
life is suffering, right?

If we say, well, life is suffering,

then what am I doing then

I'm trying to erase from my mind

like the birth of my children, right?

Like things that were
filled with joy, right?

Like life is not entirely suffering,

but life brings a lot of suffering

and for some people it brings

such disproportionate suffering

and the people don't
survive the suffering.

And I think when people are conscientious

and empathic that really
bothers us, right?

The suffering in our own lives

and the fact that others at times

could seem to be so
overwhelmed by suffering

that they don't even get
a chance to see good.

And I do think there's truth to that

and there's sadness and distress to that,

but to say therefore life is suffering,

I think is just completely untrue.

And, you know,

it ignores the fact that someone

even made a trombone, right?

Let alone that there's
a little bit outta sync

and someone's playing the trombone.

Like that's cool.

There's a, you know,

there's elements of the
absurd that you said are neat

and interesting and if
we start accepting that

we can't understand or control everything,

then we can accept and I think really love

and foster the beauty in our lives.

- Yeah, I think the word suffering

is doing a little bit too much work.

'Cause I think it's probably referring

to the philosophical concept of that.

Yeah, there's absurd, the absurdity.

Stuff just happens randomly.

Evil people succeed, good people fail.

There's a seeming random
injustice on occasion.

And on occasion there's justice and yeah,

all of it that feels like,

and maybe because it often
there's a lot of loss

and then there's a kind of
matching complimentary aspect

to any good feeling that
all comes crashing down.

Like every hello.

From a physics perspective
ends in a goodbye.

Like, that's a really sad thing.

Like I've, you know,

all the amazing people I
get to meet in my life,

all the amazing experiences,
eventually they have to end

and that's part of what
makes them amazing.

- But why is that sad?

Is it because we're taught to
think that I said like, look,

at some point you and I are
gonna say goodbye today.

Like, I hope we're richer for it.

And then we take that
goodness off with us.

Like, I wanna celebrate that because

it's all part of the goodness.

I think we're taught to think, oh,

that's so bad and it's
equates to death and misery

and I think it's often not that way.

- I think there is a sadness to it, but

I also don't think that
sadness is a negative thing.

It's a different way to
celebrate a beautiful thing.

So there's a melancholic nature to it.

There's something passing of it leaving.

I mean it's that old Louis C.K.
thing that I go back to over

and over from a show Louie,

where he was all heartbroken
that he just broke up,

you know, with somebody he loved.

And he told about that to an old man

and the old man said, "You're a fool,

that's the best part."

I miss that part where you sort of

are lingering in that loss.

You feeling the pain of that loss because

that lasts the longest,
it's the most intense,

it's the most reliable
and it's the kind of

celebration of the love you had.

Like losing the love is still
a celebration of the love with

I think you don't want
to over romanticize that,

but there's some aspect of truth to that,

like that melancholic
feeling of remembering

a beautiful time that's no longer there

is a kind of celebration of it

and is a kind of joyful experience.

Even though it's very
easy to experience it

as a negative emotion.

I think it's just like you said,

I mean it's up to our mind to determine

how that emotion's really felt.

But it's a tricky one
'cause it's like heartbreak

to experience that as a positive thing.

- People can reminisce at funerals, right?

And laugh because people
can be very, very,

very sad and perceive that this person

has died and perceive the sadness of it.

But in perceiving that
and really living in it,

then you can have people who
wanna remember that person

by like telling a funny story, why?

Because each of those people
carries that with them.

So I think what you're saying

is consistent with healthy
function as human beings,

because we're gonna
encounter sadness and loss.

Like what do we do with that? Right?

And do we do things that
ultimately create some redemption

or even reparation inside of us?

And like, reparation's a big
word in psychology, right?

It's how we repair damage and loss.

So if we lose someone
and we're sad, can we,

by telling funny stories
about that person,

remind ourselves that, hey,
they're still inside of us.

Whether they're out there
looking at me, I don't know,

but I can call that person
in mind inside of us.

And then we have something

that's good and beautiful
that comes of that too.

- In the introduction
to your book on trauma,

lady Gaga wrote it.

She wrote the forward, the intro.

She said this about you,

"I can now say with certainty
that this man saved my life.

He made life worth living."

This goes to our
discussion about the myth,

Sisyphus Camus question about why I live.

So I think at least to me,

she's one of the most brilliant
and unique artists ever.

So it's a difficult question,
but a question of creativity.

What role does trauma play
in somebody like that?

In this artist that has
created some incredible things?

What positive, constructive
role does trauma serve?

And what limiting role does it serve

in preventing that person
from flourishing more?

- Trauma can certainly drive
us to creativity, right?

To even to push against or to protest

against what the trauma tells us.

You know, trauma tells us
lessons like nothing matters

and you don't matter, and
nothing will ever be good.

And then nothing is beautiful.

And we can push against trauma.

They know there is life in me.

There's something, there's goodness for me

to spread in the world,
to express and spread.

So I think trauma fuels creativity
in many, many, many ways.

Trauma also shuts down creativity, right?

Or people who are for, it's one example,

a trauma that escalates
to the point where now

the person is soothing it with alcohol.

It's one example.

And now the impact of the alcohol
shuts down any creativity.

So can people be creative

and outward thinking without trauma?

I think sometimes, if
I remember correctly,

people will use Manuel Cont
as an example of someone

who I think hadn't traveled
much and didn't have trauma,

and like, look at what he knew.

So, okay, they're gonna
be exceptions, right?

But a lot of our
creativity is in some ways

fueled by our suffering,

although it's complicated

because it comes from
generative places in us, right?

So those places are there.

They're not created by suffering,

but maybe suffering makes an incentive

or a passion inside of us.

And a person, you know, Stephanie,

who you referred to as
just such an incredible,

astounding creative force.

And sure, some of that comes from trauma,

some of it comes from, you know,

trauma fueling the generative
creative places in her.

But what I helped her to do,

she's very generous with her words,

but what I helped her to do
was to see all that she is,

and all that the creativity in her is,

and all that there is to,

to create through love
and caring and compassion.

And to again, see that,
I mean, a lot of time,

that's what I'm doing, clinic.

I think it's what's good psychiatrists

or mental health professionals
do is we help people

see the beauty that is there, right?

Because oftentimes we're way
too close up to that tapestry.

And what brings us close
is often the sad thing.

So we're up close and all
we see is the negative.

I mean, it's easy then to
get classically nihilistic,

but by helping someone
take a step back and to see

who they are and what's in them,

that's how people get better.

And it's how people reengage in life.

- It's such a difficult
thing because if you were to,

from studying human beings,

it seems like the optimal
trajectory is having some trauma

that doesn't destroy you,

that forces you early in
life to really struggle

with the intricacies
of the human condition.

And then later in life,

as you form and like you
build an expertise on

and mastery start to do
exactly what you said,

which is step back and
look at the tapestry.

So if you don't have the trauma,

it seems like, just empirically speaking,

there's of course just
a huge amount of data

in all kinds of anecdotal evidence.

But, and I'm wanna be careful here

'cause maybe I'm romanticizing hardship,

but it does seem that
hardship in childhood,

if it doesn't break,
you can be constructive.

It's like you said, having that trauma,

one of the ways to fight it is
to say, I am worth something.

And this is, you know, David
Gogi talks about this is like,

this is, I am somebody,
I can be somebody special

and I'm gonna prove it to you.

I'm gonna do this, I'm
gonna do this big thing,

and it's this engine
that drives you forward.

Yeah, comment on that.

Because like from a, like
a parent's perspective,

you want a child to have
an easy life, right?

You want them to not have hardship,

certainly not have trauma,

but that's such a difficult dance

because in some ways a
little bit of hardship

and gradually increasing amount

of hardship that doesn't break you,

can really develop you
into a really interesting,

complicated person and
it helps you flourish

as a creative being.

I don't know what the, I don't know.

I don't know if there's
a question to that.

I'll just keep random
saying random things.

- No, it makes, look,
I think it makes good,

it makes good sense to me.

I think you're trying
to get at like, look,

we need trauma and like,

and what and how are
we defining it, right?

Because we say trauma,
hardship, difficulties,

I mean, we could set aside,

we could set apart say
in differentiate things

that are difficult but that
are overcomeable, right?

Versus things that we could use trauma,

the word trauma this way, if we chose to,

that are just like entirely negative.

Like someone saying, oh,

you can't do that and you'll
never succeed because what?

And then they tell you
something about yourself.

Okay, because you're from
here or you're this race,

religion, whatever it is, right?

We think, well, you know,

that could make someone say,
Hey, I'm gonna show you,

I'm gonna overcome, right?

But then they're overcoming
something bad, right?

Like, it's just like,

there's nothing good or
helpful about that, right?

If someone's saying that.

So a person has to overcome it,

that's different than something

that is placed in front of a person

where the whole conception
of it is something positive

that you can make through effort, right?

So, you know, I remember, I dunno,

I think I was 15 years old.

There was some rule like
where you could then go,

I don't think it was picking raspberries

or blueberries, right?

And I think, and my parents
wanted me to see like,

hey, go see how that work as you,

and now you got 50 cents
at the end of it, right?

And then you think about that

when you know you wanna buy
baseball cards or you know,

you think about it and you work hard.

And I could remember like,

it was hard and I was
sweating and I was tired

but I learned from it.

I mean, it's the reason
I remember it today.

So yes, parents might want their kids

to have like a good life, right?

But not necessarily an
easy life, you know?

And I think that was done,
they took me to do that

so I had a greater sense of responsibility

and a sense of like,

hard work is meaningful
and it's important.

And I think that that
kind of thing is good.

But if we separate that from something

that's just denigrating,
prejudicial, like,

I think those things aren't
good, but they're unavoidable.

So it's not necessarily that,
oh, is some trauma good.

I would look at it more that
some trauma's unavoidable.

I mean, you know, it's hard to go...

How do you go through life
and not have any losses

or anything negative or anything sad?

And then people are people,

there may be people who
have not a lot of that,

and then there's a sort of complacency

and they don't do it as much as they could

or feel as good as they could, you know?

Then there's other people

who have a highly attuned emotional,

there's people with very highly
attuned emotional compasses

for which a little bit of
trauma becomes so intrusive.

So it's so much of it is person driven.

But I do wanna distinguish
between things that are just

purely bad that we might
overcome or find some fire

in our belly about, or
whatever the case may be,

and things that may be
boundaries or barriers either

directly purposely placed or not,

that in a sense invite us

or inform us of the possibility
of striving and overcoming.

- Finally in tune into
emotional compasses.

That's so true that there is,
that's a component of it too.

There's almost genetic

how sensitive you are
to a particular trauma.

So little things can have a huge impact

or gigantic things,
serious abuse in childhood

can be by some people
overcome more easily.

- It's so interesting.
- It's not just

what's the trauma,

because what's the trauma
that makes certain problems?

You have to match the
trauma to the person.

And a big part of what you're
matching to is that, you know,

genetically based characteristic
of how finely attuned

is that empathic
attunement to that compass.

- So when you think about
let's just return to childhood,

when you think about trauma in childhood,

what can we say about
the impact of child abuse

on the development of a human being?

- I think the impact of it

is so disproportionately bad, hurtful

compared to things that happen
when we're not children.

And I wanna be very careful
about how I'm saying that

because people can,

through their strength and resilience

and human interconnectedness
can overcome that.

I don't mean to say that
anyone who's experienced

those things is can't make
it through it or over it.

That part is not true.

But it is true that the
impact is so disproportionate

to anything else that can happen

because the brain is formulating, right?

So both, you know,

if we say psychology is like
applied neurobiology, right?

And we look at both of those
as different ends, right?

Even though there's a lot
of gray in the middle,

you know, the neurobiology is changed.

So just one example of

a much greater salience
of vigilance mechanisms

of mechanisms of self-protection,

mechanisms that can make
a person feel more fear

and more insecurity and hide
themselves away from the world

and not trust the world.

And I mean, not trust the
world even enough that,

oh, I, you know, I'd like
to have a better job.

And there's, and you know,

another one is here that I could take,

but maybe you could be worse, you know,

being afraid of that, right?

Like all sorts of ways
in which the changes

to those pathways impact someone.

And that's just one of, you know,

we could bring trauma experts together

that could talk about
that for days, right?

Like, what is the impact
upon the brain biology?

So that then gets changed
inside the person.

And from the perspective of those changes,

the psychology on top of it changes.

Like, what do I think about myself?

Do I think that I'm worthwhile?

You know, even in my mid
twenties after, you know,

without formative traumas and
a pretty strong sense of self

and some achievements,
there's a big trauma then

with the death of my brother
and I start questioning,

am I cursed?

Am I worth anything?

I mean, I was 20 something years old

and doing reasonably well at the time.

You know, how does this impact a child

of 6, 7, 10, 12 years old, right?

We're sending such powerful messages

that then change conception of self.

And that negatively change conception

sits upon the negatively
changed neurobiology.

And I think if we really thought, hey,

let's do the best we can
just for humans in general,

for the human race,
for species in general,

is we would handle children

and caring for children
so much differently

in terms of protection mechanisms,
intervention mechanisms.

How many times do you see

where like there's now
there's been some tragedy

and the, you know, child gets
a little bit of support and,

you know, they had some therapy, you know,

that was provided by some
insurance carrier, you know,

that they got once a week
for 16 weeks or whatever.

I mean, we should be wrapping
our societal resources

around children, but we
don't use our resources.

Well, you know, I was just reading,

it's a little bit of an aside,

but about 300 and something
billion dollars a year in cost

to the US economy just from schizophrenia.

And you think, and it costs a fraction,

what do we actually put into caring

for people who have schizophrenia?

So first there's a moral imperative,

but let's say we put that aside

and we only care about the economy, right?

Because there are mechanisms of thinking

that look at it that way.

How could we not amend that? Right?

But we are so reckless with our resources

and we're tripping ahead of ourselves

that we don't think, oh my goodness,

there is no better place on
God's earth for prevention

than here prevention in
terms of human suffering.

And also where do people like that go?

I mean, more often people like

that go to place of increased suffering,

inability to take care of themselves

or to be in supportive relationships.

Okay, we know there's a
higher prevalence of that,

but we're also creating the pool of people

through which the envy, the
narcissism, the sociopathy,

the destruction arises.

So again, if we care about people,

we would be so focused on that.

If we don't care about other
people and just ourselves

or just economic costs, we
would still be so focused.

But, you know, we're not,

and we tend to just kind of call it good

because we don't see
anything disastrous happening

at the moment.

And I think there's a
societal negligence there

to the shame really of
all of us when child abuse

and the impact neurobiologically

and psychologically is
potentially the greatest cause

of suffering directly and indirectly

on the face of the planet.

- How much does trauma of that kind

and later in life affect your ability

to love another human being,
say inside a relationship,

connect with another human being?

- It can impact it a lot.

And again, I wanna say,

can people overcome and be as loving

to a partner or a child or anyone else?

Yes. But we're talking
across society, right?

How are we setting the odds, right?

We're setting the odds towards

a higher sense of vigilance,

a decreased sense of self-confidence,

an increased sense of
vulnerability, right?

A decreased comfort
interacting with others, right?

What we're doing is we're
pushing towards isolation

and misery and depression and resentment.

I mean, those factors push
towards that, you know,

and we know that the
research is so strong that

you know, adverse childhood experiences

at these things that happen,

the more, the worse, the more prolonged,

the more that person is up against

as they try and navigate life.

- And I suppose one of
the elements of intimacy,

like we were talking
about is vulnerability.

And maybe is there a
fear of being vulnerable?

Of being hurt again?

Is that ultimately the
barrier to intimacy?

- Yeah, if you're taught a lesson

that says the world is not safe

and you're not good enough
for someone to keep safe

and you're not strong enough
to keep yourself safe,

that's a final common pathway

of the vast majority of child abuse races

telling those lessons to people,

then how can that not
change the lay of the land

against openness, against the ability

to rationally consider trust and mutuality

and to protect oneself, but
also take chances and, you know,

do the things that we have to do

to create the greatest
happiness in our lives.

We set the odds so much against them.

- As another pathway, which I think is,

is really interesting because
I've seen it in people

is is this kind of
ability to detach yourself

from feeling any emotions
to like protect yourself.

It's almost like you're not quite there.

- There's a word. It's
isolation of affect.

This is a defense mechanism.

- Yeah. Isolation of affect.

Is that a common way,

another common way to deal with trauma?

- Well, isolation of
affect can cut both ways.

So if there's been a major
trauma as if someone has seen

something terrible and they're
isolated from their affect,

and at one time it was thought,

well maybe that's good, right?

They're not hysterical.

They're not distraught, but we
see that is not good, right?

Because what needs to be held, processed?

Do we need to get our arms
around in some way, shape,

or form has just been
separated off, right?

So we know that is not good, right?

But isolation of affect
can also service very well.

I think back to being an intern, you know,

a medical intern in the
hospital and you know,

you might have to go and
pronounce someone dead with,

you know, with hysterical family members.

And then, you know, 10 minutes later,

five minutes later might be
two minutes later, really,

you know, you have to go to another room

and you've gotta maybe do
some procedure that involves,

you know, having your
focus on a certain thing

and making sure your hand movements

are the right way.

Or talking to a person in a way that is,

that's very different than
where you just came from.

That's very hopeful.

And so then you have to isolate the affect

of what's going on around you.

And it, you know, happens not just in,

it's just one example,

but we have to do it in life
so that we can put affect aside

to process later or not feel
the full weight of affect

where we know the meaning.

Like I know the meaning of
the tragedy of the person

I just pronounced dead,

but I want to separate that for myself.

'Cause I'm also aware
that it's not my tragedy,

so that I can then okay,

put that affect aside
and go do the next thing

that I have to do.

So that I think can cut both ways.

- Right, but then you
have to like reattach it,

understand that it's good
to be close with emotion,

even painful emotion, right?

Like, because that's the human experience.

It's like, I feel like
if you build up a skill

that you can detach yourself from emotion,

I think that could become

its own kind of addictive qualities.

- It can become too easy to do it.

And to reinforce,

that's when people are suffering too much

over too long a period of time,

then, you know, we're
creatures of habit, right?

And even though our brains are,

you can talk about our brains

are sitting on the shoulders of the giant,

of the maybe thousand levels of emergence

that come underneath of them.

Our brains are also working

in very simple habit based ways.

Like if you and I chose a word right now

and said it 500 times,

we would know it's just
a silly experiment,

but we'd both be saying it tonight, right?

Because our brains are
also creatures of habit.

So if you over and over and
over have to isolate yourself

from affect and you develop
those mechanisms, well,

you develop those mechanisms

and they don't go away any easier than

if we said the word 500
times and decided to forget.

We won't forget no matter what we decided.

- So how do we find our way back?

How do we overcome trauma?

What are the different pathways?

- The first thing,

the very first thing is to
acknowledge to ourselves

and often to others,

which might be one other person

it might be in words spoken,

it might be written what
the trauma has been, right?

Because the lessons of trauma,
the evil lessons of trauma,

and I'll use the example of my own life,

the lesson that told me
that I was shameful, cursed,

and hopeless, right?

It's a very evil lesson, right?

But my brain will say it over

and did say it over and
over and over to me.

And if that just sits inside,

that's how trauma festers,
that's how trauma hijacks are.

Thoughts are emotions.

So being able to say to
ourselves and to another, like,

this is what's happened, right?

Okay, this is what's happened.

We're built to massage words

and to create meaning
through words, right?

Like, we don't massage pictures, right?

Images, we talk and
massage meaning with words.

So when I finally went to see a therapist

and I could say, you know, my brother,

whatever words I would've said, like,

he killed himself and I,

I can't accept it or I can't imagine it.

And like I let it happen.

Like, so I had to say those things, right?

So then I could begin to bring some sense

of truth to it, you know?

And it was a long time ago,

but the therapist probably
says something like, okay,

probably seize on you, you let it happen.

It's your fault, right?

Because you gotta get at those things

so that one can begin to bring into focus.

What does a trauma mean
and what does it not mean?

I mean, a classic example is the

what would you say to someone else?

Example, you know, you'll say, well,

now how many times have I, it is just,

I cry if I stop and think about it enough,

stop and talk to someone
who is sexually assaulted

through no fault of their own,

who comes in and tells the
story they've been telling

themselves about how it's their fault.

They should have walked
home a different way.

They should address differently.

They should have left earlier, right?

I wrote about it in the
book over and over and over.

Now they have a person who,

let's say you take a person
who's intelligent engage

in the world, who's like,

capable of understanding lots
and lots and lots of things,

but doesn't understand that, right?

If it were someone else,

that person would understand in a moment,

that's not that person's fault, right?

So what you wanna do is
overcome the fact that

the negative emotions, that
the hijacked emotion systems

of trauma are telling that person a lie.

And they're telling them
so strongly and so awfully,

so meanly that the person
just takes it inside

and starts to see it as true, right?

So you begin to hold that
up to the light of day.

And again, one example
could be okay, so someone,

the person who's coming in next

has actually been through
something similar, right?

And can do you mind,

can you stay and just tell
her how it's her fault, right?

And like, oh my god, no.

Oh, because I could never,
like, then they see, right?

I mean, again, this is
not always how you do it,

but sometimes you can
get a person to see like,

well that would be the most horrible,

how could you do that, right?

And then person can maybe come out there

doing it to themselves.

So you know, you begin to put
words in a structure and say,

okay, look, let's look at
what's going on inside of you.

Like, you don't have to
be scared of anything

you're thinking and feeling.

In fact, the fear is in not
exposing it to the light,

to the light of day.

That's where it gets the best of us.

And now, like everything is different

and whether that involves
use of medications

for intrusive thoughts and depression,

or there's no medicines
needed, but it's all reframing,

like whatever it may be that comes next,

the whole world has changed
when the person has acknowledged

what's happened, exposed it to themselves

and to trusted others
around them and begun to

look at it in some way other
than the stuffed in an evil box

place that the trauma
initially puts us through

the reflexes it creates in us.

- It's interesting that there's power

as you're saying it out loud.

So first saying your
perception of it out loud,

then in that case that
might be your fault.

And then working through out
loud, working through that.

It may not be.

- Any experienced therapist
will tell you this,

that every now and then it will happen.

That someone will come
and they'll say something.

Usually it's very early on in the process,

they'll say something
they've never said before

and they immediately are like

in an entirely different place.

And they may have been for decades, right?

And I can remember a person saying that

a coach had raped him and just saying it,

this was decades before and
everything was different.

I'm not saying everything
is now as perfect,

but as life was in a different
place, as soon as he said it,

he could see how dare,

like he thought that person
did that to this child.

The child was me.

He'd never thought it
until he said it out loud,

'cause his mind was
going over and over with

why it was his fault,
what he did to deserve it.

How he kept going back.

So it must be his fault. It was in it.

As soon as he put words to
it, he saw the truth of it.

And, you know,

there lose a bifurcation
in the path of life then.

And any therapist has had, you
know, has stories like that,

which just shows the immense power that

it can even be that just
uttering the words makes just

a cascade of change all at once.

- Just saying those words
to another human being.

Yeah.

It makes you wonder about
that compulsive loop

that happens in our heads.

Until it's brought to the
surface. It's so interesting.

- Entirely non-productive, the loops.

And sometimes even if we put,
what would I say to another,

let me write it down.

It can get rid of those
loops in our brains.

Any even thought of outward
expression is the enemy of those

internal persecutory
negative thought loops.

- How do you find a good therapist?

I tend to think of, listen,
I'm a fan of podcasts,

I'm a fan of conversations.

It feels like a real, you know,

it's like finding a good
friend or something.

It feels like a difficult journey.

Maybe I'm wrong in that, but
it just feels like such a,

it feels like a partnership,
a journey together

versus like some very
simple clinical procedure.

- Well, the first thing I would say

is to change the entire paradigm.

Like most people like,
okay, I need a therapist.

So people feel often like
they're in a weakened position

because they need, you
know, "AA therapist".

Then therapists are rationed, right?

I mean, how many insurance
panels have lists a mile long of

qualified therapists who could
be on that insurance panel,

but there's a certification process,

like this is making no sense, right?

The state's already
certified the person, right?

But there's so many barriers to entry

that now we're rationing this resource,

which we should all stop
and pause for a second

and think like, we're okay
with that as a society.

And by the way,

everything else is like that too

when we're trying to
get help for our health.

So let's step back from that for a second.

Now it's a resource that's
not in great supply.

And then a person begins
to think, you know,

essentially I'll take what I can get.

Like I just gotta get somebody

and I don't know enough
to know anyway, right?

And those are very disempowering
thoughts as opposed

to saying, look, I'm gonna
be an empowered consumer

and I wanna, I need to
choose someone who gets over.

It's not just some basic
hurdles of what I think are

reasonable human interaction, right?

So like, is a person making eye contact,

do they seem interested, right?

Like these are basic points
about any human interaction,

including a therapist, right?

Then you can say, okay,
is there a word of mouth?

Anyone else has something good?

Nothing better than a word
of mouth recommendation

from someone you trust, right?

Or anybody can have a
good website, but you say,

let me look at the website.

What is it saying if there is one, right?

Does it resonate with me or not? Right?

But after all of that,

then you go to see the
person with the idea

that you're interviewing them, right?

The idea that, yeah, I hope
this person can help me,

and if so, great, I'm with the program,

but I'm thinking about it.

Do I want this person?

Do I feel heard, do I feel cared for?

Which doesn't mean is it easy, right?

It might mean is it hard?

And I leave and I feel

like emotional for a couple of days,

but I see that I'm facing new things.

No, this process of assessment,

so that one isn't settling for something

that is formulaic overpackaged.

And I'm not trying to be
overly critical of therapists.

I mean, there are people everywhere

who do their jobs well and

people who don't do their jobs well,

but most therapists are working in systems

that push against doing
the job well, right?

Because they're rationing care

and there's an allotted number of sessions

and there's enough such time
before a person can return.

And so often it's an uphill battle

because we're trying to
be helped within systems

we've created and tolerate

that are pushing against helping us.

- Yeah. But you know, that
interview process is tricky.

I mean, if you're in a
rough place mentally,

just like with any kind of interview,

it's hard not to think
that a failed interaction,

failed interview, there's
something wrong with you.

- Sure. Right?

- There is an authority
to a therapist, I think,

where you think like, they've
got it all figured out.

And I'm a mess, and therefore
if there's something off,

it's all my fault.

All right, so it's a very tricky

and it's easy to then give up and then

'cause the step to try to get a therapist,

the first like step to get
help, forget therapists,

like any kind of help.

That's a big leap to take.

Especially when you're in a rough place.

- I agree completely.

We should not make people swim
against such a strong current

to get their needs met.

I mean, we see this in such obvious places

where you have an
elderly home-bound person

who can't get their medicine because oh,

there's been some change

and they didn't put the
new number into the form

or Lord knows what I mean.

It's incredible how we force people

to swim against strong
currents to get things

that are just basic at
times for their survival.

And with that in mind,

I don't have a lot of respect
for where healthcare is at

or where mental health is at.

The field that I work in has accepted

all sorts of aspects of how things go.

Someone else controlling

how long the interaction can go on,

how the interaction is bounded,
what can be said and done,

what medicines can be prescribed.

There's so many external controls
in the systems we work in

that we, and I say me included,

like all of us in the field
have let it get to a place where

it's obscenely difficult to
get help, obscenely difficult.

And we should say that's not okay.

I think psychiatrists and therapists

and master's level social workers,

psychologists, and you name it,

I think we should all
all say this is not okay.

And then we as a society should
be saying, this is not okay.

Otherwise what you're saying,

which is I think completely true,

will only become worse as
there's more and more barriers

to getting the help a person needs.

And each time a person isn't helped,

it sets the odds against
them getting more help.

I should say, Hugh, that, you
know, when I started working,

there were times I would send people

to an emergency room, right?

If there was some emergency, you know,

emergency in their mental
health and they were at risk.

And there were times I'd send
somebody to an emergency room

where if you stopped and looked,

it would've been malpractice
not to do that, right?

Now it's not just me

who has an incredibly high
threshold for sending someone to

an emergency room because you
send someone who's in a lot of

distress and oftentimes
they're sitting on a gurney

in a hallway,

or they're locked in a small white room

and all they had was depression, you know,

they're just scared when they
go in and 36 hours later, oh,

they're feeling a little better, why?

'Cause they're desperate
to get out of there

and someone sends them home.

I mean, so our systems
have shifted so much that

we tolerate now on mass what
is egregious to the individual.

- So you are a psychiatrist

in terms of doing therapy, psychotherapy.

What does the successful
interaction look like?

Perhaps a fun question, perhaps not.

What do you think of the psychiatrist,

Sean and Goodwill Hunting
played by Robin Williams?

So what is the full range
of interesting interactions?

Can there be an intimacy, a friendship,

a kind of varied interaction
that kind of blends the lines

of, you know, 30 minutes
session once a week or whatever,

versus like a really kind of
deliberate long-term project

that cares about the wellbeing of a person

across the months and years.

What can you say about
a successful interaction

between therapists and patient?

- I think we're much better
served by the latter, right?

And again, it doesn't
have to be over years.

We maybe a person doesn't,

a person might need that over weeks.

They might need it over months,

they might need it over years.

But if I'm understanding correctly,

you're describing something

that is like a real
human engagement, right?

And look, I work in a field that

for years and years and years,

the patient didn't get to see the right,

the therapist was sitting in a place

sitting behind the person, right?

So that's not,

of course the only tradition
and there are aspects of that

tradition that can be very humanized.

But the idea that we're
supposed to not be human,

I mean this medicine is shut
through with this, right?

That the doctor's supposed
to be God and it protects

the doctor and that makes
its way into therapy.

And the idea of the superiority,
the therapist knows more.

I mean, in some ways yes.

But the idea is like to know more about

mechanical things, like, right.

To know more about like
facts and knowledge,

not as a human being, right?

If we approach therapy

as a collaborative human endeavor, right?

Where if we're gonna do it together,

of course I'm gonna learn
from you too, right?

I mean, we're two human beings

and we're talking about
things that are deep

and personal and intimate.

And I'm don't wanna,

I'm not gonna participate in
a way that makes it like about

me as much as it's about you.

But we're two humans and
what's going on in me

may have relevance and
sharing it may have relevance.

And at times you doing something back

for me may have relevance.

I'll give you an example of a person

who would not let me help him.

It was a young man.

So when I was in training who was very,

very sick and needed to change
certain choices and habits

or he was not gonna survive

and I had no ability
to help him whatsoever.

And I went and I saw a supervisor

who is existentially trained.

Where here it's different
from existentialism

in the classic sense,

but it's about really
human connection, right?

And the guy was always wanting
to teach me something, right?

Because I can get by in Spanish,

but he was fluent in
Spanish and he wanted,

he'd, oh, you traveled here.

And he'd say, you know,

a word to see if I knew and
I was always directing back

to what I was supposed to do, right?

And the supervisor, I'll
never forget, he said,

"Let him teach you
Spanish. Like, come on."

So we had a couple sessions where

if you looked from the outside,

he'd say, "What is going on there?"

Like, right.

Like this, they were Spanish
lessons to me, right?

And then at some point

he brought in his mother and it was,

he hadn't brought her in yet.

And he was in part showing off

that he taught me something, right?

And I said a couple things
and he felt more powerful.

Like, he was younger than me

and he felt sick and disempowered,

but he didn't feel that way
once he taught me something.

And we showed her off
to his mother, right?

And his behavior started to change.

He started taking better care of himself.

He could see a little
more what I was saying.

He was like, you're a wonderful person.

Look, you love your mother and
your aunt and they love you.

And like, look, he could start
seeing that about himself.

But that came from humanness and I think

that's the way we help people.

I don't understand why we
don't do everything that way.

It was like, we're two humans.

But if you're doing something for me,

then there's something, you
have an expertise and I don't,

that's why you're doing it for me,

the reverse could be true,

but it doesn't mean we're not just

two humans doing something together.

- And the healthcare
system and the legal system

should not get in the way of that.

I mean, there's liability
and all these kinds of things

that can get in the way
of the humanness, right?

I mean, some of that is justified.

You have to be careful.

You have to make sure
there's, you're responsible,

but a little too much can
destroy the humanness.

- I'll use a word

I don't usually you say
something is insane.

Like it's not consistent with sanity.

And the presence of the legal system.

Look, I'm all for of course,
physicians have to be held.

We have to be responsible
and everybody makes mistakes

and people have to be
accountable for their mistakes.

I understand all of that.

But what we see now, it's so absurd that,

oh, like everyone is frightened.

Everyone is frightened
then just looking to like,

how do I slot into the box,

check the boxes of what I'm supposed to do

and not get in trouble.

You know, people get sued

because someone was at that hospital

and that doctor touched their care.

It happens in the VA system,

it happens in other systems too.

So you might have touched their care

and no one's even saying
you did anything wrong.

But they say the next person did, oh,

someone settled on your behalf

and now you have a malpractice ding.

And maybe you can't get
a license somewhere else.

Like, doctors are terrified
and they're terrified for good.

They're terrified for good reason.

Because the same society that
is given doctors in many ways,

too much power over time

and treated doctors
maybe too much like Gods

now is I think enacting
some of society's anger

and envy out on the physicians.

Even the idea that like a
person would know what medicine,

like I saw a couple TV
commercials, give me this.

It's like, it's interesting, right?

Because even if, let's
say I take myself out,

it doesn't feel good obviously,

but it takes a, it's like, wow,

like I went to school for
like eight years for this

and you don't even wanna
hear my opinion, right?

You're not taking good
care of yourself, right.

It doesn't mean you should
think my opinion is gospel

'cause I said it.

But people then don't have
an understanding of like,

what is expertise?

What do people learn?

How can people help us understand
and make better decisions?

It kind of goes out with the wash

and then the position of the expert,

I mean it's a lot has been
written about this right?

Gets diminished over time,
very much to our own peril.

And then often with aggression
in the medical world

coming back towards the alleged expert.

- Yeah. Expertise is a tricky one.

It's such a tricky thing because

coupled with expertise can,

the attention is this arrogance

that can come with expertise.

The arrogance can make the
expert feel like they're

more of an expert and
there's a vicious cycle.

And then the arrogance in the current,

in the 21st century,
especially with the internet,

the arrogance can
completely force the public

to distrust the expert.

'Cause all they see is the
arrogance versus the expertise.

So ultimately you have
to have, I think the,

the greatest experts and masters I know

are the ones that have complete humility.

- Humility and gratitude.

- And gratitude.
- Leads us back.

- Which is a usually a really good sign

that somebody is at
the top of their field.

- Right, and they'll acknowledge that

they don't know everything, right?

- Which is hilarious.

So like the best experts
I know are the ones

that will say that they don't know.

They would not call themselves an expert.

It's very confusing.

- Or know that they know a lot

but don't know the answer to this.

You see that a lot in medicine.

That person knows they're
an expert surgeon,

but they also acknowledge
they don't know if this

is the right time to operate.

That's how you get to the best answer

instead of someone who is an expert

and always knows the answer.

- If we actually rewind to the beginning

of our conversation, we talked about,

you mentioned something
I wanted to return to.

So there's layers that are,

there's an emergent
novelty and you mentioned

that we as human beings and
we introspect on our own mind,

we really can't know most of it.

Which of course makes me think of this,

the unconscious mind,
subconscious mind and Carl Young,

how much is hiding there in the shadows?

You've investigated a lot of trauma.

How much is there in our mind

that's not directly accessible to us?

Like what can you say
maybe philosophically

about how much is there
lurking in the jungian shadow?

- I think there's a
tremendous amount there,

but I wouldn't...

I don't immediately go to an
ominous perspective, right.

Because if it's lurking there, right?

It can come get us and to
some extent that's true.

The seeds of evil are
there if we wanna plant

and nurture them.

- You think good things can't lurk?

- I guess so otherwise-

- I was being poetic.

But you're right, you're absolutely right.

And the jungian shadow is supposed

to not just be dark things.

It's supposed to be everything.

It's supposed to be a lot of
positive things as well. Yeah.

- Right, which I think
brings us to self-knowledge,

to truth where I think
the opposite of envy,

narcissism, sociopathy, I do
think is all rooted in truth.

It's both the truth of
the good things about us

or the ways we are not
blameable for the, blameworthy

for the things we're blaming
ourselves for, et cetera.

But the self-knowledge and the truth

and getting away from the reflex of anger,

frustration, envy, shame.

What I think happens then is

all of that underneath the surface,

if we look at like the
consciousness is the top of the

iceberg, you know, outside the top, say,

well outside the water,

so is what's underneath like
shifting and it can pull

the top underwrite or is
it supporting the top?

And really I believe is
honesty, truth, self-knowledge,

humility, gratitude,
all this simple stuff.

Good mental health is always
consistent with simplicity.

Like, you know, humility,

gratitude or easy things to say like

we know what that is, right?

We understand what that is.

Soothing envy by having immense power

and subjugating others is
getting very, very complicated.

What that is and how that plays out.

So if we are in touch with ourselves,

if we're honest with ourselves,

if we own what's ours and we don't try

and own what's not ours, right?

What happens then is something
isn't waiting inside of us

to sort of jump us with some new fact

of self or challenge of self, right?

Then I think what happens are phenomena

like intrinsic learning,

like the way that so
much happens inside of us

automatically, right?

How people who have high levels
of expertise know the answer

to complex questions more rapidly, right?

It doesn't take them
longer to think through it,

but they have more
knowledge to think through.

It's that more happens
rapidly and unconsciously

so they know the more complex answer

more quickly and readily, right?

And we can build that in ourselves,

not just in terms of factual knowledge,

but in terms of how we
respond to things, right?

If I make a mistake,

do I respond with reflexive shame, right?

If I see someone has something I'd like,

how do I respond?

We're more in accord with ourselves

and then the automaticity
in us is serving us better.

- So that's in the positive.

Do do you think,

do you draw some wisdom from

the early pioneers of
psychotherapy like Freud and Young?

That there's some repressed,

there's some stuff to work through

that is in the unconscious mind?

- Yes, I think there's
always like 100% of the time,

if you have a living human,

you have things to work through

in the unconscious mind, right?

There's too much that goes on around us

that we might find unacceptable
and suppress, right?

There can be smaller but
important examples, right?

Someone who feels that they're
not a good enough parent

and they, I don't know, they
drop the child's plate, right?

And there's a feeling about
that of badness in them

that the person that can't
tolerate and pushes away, right?

And maybe they become a
little bit less confident,

a little bit less assertive.

Like those small examples are important

because they may be low valence,

but there can be many, many, many, many,

many of them, right?

Then you can look at the opposite end

of the spectrum where
someone, for example,

feels or they have to,

they're repressing their sexuality, right?

Unconsciously, something
that is so important,

say to help a person
feels about themselves

to whether they can seek fulfillment

to how they feel about their
ability to interact and engage

with others in ways that are loving

and generative over time.

so from smaller things
that accumulate often

at rapid pace to really big things,

we are pushing things into the unconscious

because they're not acceptable
and we need to explore like,

why is that not accept?

Maybe there's a non unacceptable urge

'cause it's really not
acceptable to me, right?

Like a violent urge.

Maybe there's an unacceptable urge

because I'm actually listening to the lie

society is telling me about what's okay

and what's not okay, right?

So in exploring those things, yes,

we become happier and healthier.

And that could mean if we're
already happier and happy

and healthy, it gets better,

we get more insulated
against the negative.

Or it can mean the person
who's really nurturing

some of those seeds of evil and envy

does that less or steps away from it.

So whether it's good or it's bad,

it's in there inside of us and we benefit

from understanding that idea
of the observing ego, right?

Like we said, the part
that can stop and say, Hey,

this is what I see what's going on in me.

- What have you learned about
exploring the human mind,

about the art of conversation

is ultimately therapy's conversation?

Is there something you could,
you can put into words?

Like what makes it a good conversation?

- I think language is among
the most amazing gifts we have

and it's also one of the most like,

clunky routes to misunderstanding, right?

I think of like, there's a
concept of tacticity, you know,

things that are like, I
guess necessary evils.

And from the religious perspective,

I think is where the word started,

but of language being
like a tacticity, right?

That we need to communicate
with one another.

We want to communicate.

So we develop words and we
have these amazing brains that

can have language and
that's all well and good,

but our fantasy would be
more like Mr. Spock, right?

You know, the Vulcan mind meld.

It's like I communicate with
you 'cause we put our hands on

one another and we know,
you know, by doing this,

what we're thinking
and what we're feeling,

and we won't have misunderstanding.

So, because I think we can approximate

that we can come kind of
close with language, right?

Or we can be so far away
from it that we can say

the same word and of opposite meanings

and have it generated
immediate animosity, right?

That we need to be very,
very careful with language,

with communication, with conversations.

And I've come to understand that much,

much more as I've gotten older,

both in terms of how hurtful,
you know, reckless speeches,

which is why I'm horrified
by so much of what we see

in our political discourse, right?

The slurs, the negativity
that's attached to something,

to some word.

You know, how one can utter something

and it can go into another
person just into the ear,

but then go through so many
parts of the meaning of the

brain that that person feels
a pervasive sense of shame

or beleaguered, right?

So yes, reckless language
absolutely hurts people.

And we see that all the time
in ways that I think are just

atrocious and also how bad
miscommunication harmed us.

I mean I I really learned that through

a lot of different ways,

but in the work as a therapist
of like really wanting to

make sure that I'm
really understanding you

and you're really understanding me

and a lot of work goes
into that communication,

I think people, we can
get into a rhythm of it

and that it happens more easily.

But I think it's like,

it's a life and death
difference at times, you know,

lots of times right?

In the world around us,

between clear and accurate
communication and just so I said

a word because like, I
think, you know what I mean?

Or something like that.

- Yeah, so to that, I mean there's

the Camus quote that I like
as much unhappiness has come

into the world because
of things left unsaid.

So that has to do with
clear communication,

but there's also a
dance to a conversation,

a poetry to it.

There is ambiguity to language
and if you have a kind of

awareness of that ambiguity
and you play with it,

that's where wit and humor come in.

That's allows you to sneak up
to difficult topics without

sort of trampling on them, I don't know.

There's an art to it as well.

There's an art to the silence, you know,

just allowing both human beings,

one of the most intimate
things you can share

with a human being is silence.

- That's communicate.

It's a different communication,
but it ties more powerful.

- Yeah, giving a person's space,

to accumulate, to integrate,

to make sense of their
thoughts enough to say a word,

maybe a memory sparked so they
can think about that memory

and like process that memory.

- So it's not just words, right?
It's not just words, right.

Because now you're talking
about communication has

it's body language, it's, you know,

it's expressions of empathy,

it's movement, it's pauses, right?

Like the communication process is

very, very complicated and deep.

- Yeah, and some of
that is building trust,

but also challenging a person.

I wonder about that whole process

with strangers for example, of
how you do that successfully.

Like you and I just met today.

But I think a lot of our
interaction is very free.

We can get to know each
other in any way we want.

There's a few conversations
I have coming up in general

where there's a lot of other
pressures and constraints

on those conversations.

There's a danger to it,

there's risks, there's
political forces involved.

Like what it, not from my perspective,

but probably from my as well
of how do you say this thing,

what are the words that
are going to offend.

And you're learning that about
a stranger at the same time,

you know, and you don't.

It's an interesting dance

because you have to walk carefully,

but deliberately, carefully.

Because I've learned this
about myself, about others.

There's certain words
that can trigger a person

that can make a person feel poorly,

like shitty about themselves.

So you can push,

you can challenge a person about something

and they're totally okay with it,

but if you use a certain word
to do it right, it's gonna,

maybe it maps to some childhood
thing that their father

or mother used to say
or something like this.

And I mean,

part of the art of conversation
is actually being a little

bit free and using those words,

but being extremely sensitive in detecting

when a person reacts to a particular word.

And like storing that
away, it's like, okay,

then we might wanna return to that later.

'Cause there might be an interesting,

that could be a tip of an
iceberg that's actually

representing something beautiful.

Or you might want to just,

it's a nothing word that
you just wanna avoid

because it's a distraction.

And so all of that kind
of has to be integrated

into the dance language.

This is really interesting,

especially when the stakes are really high

when you get one conversation, right?

When you sit down,

you have one conversation
and it makes the difference

between, like, say you had one
conversation with a patient,

this is the only conversation
you get to help them.

- Sometimes that is the case.

Yeah.

- And like, this is pretty high stakes.

Oh man.

Yeah, it's tough.

I guess you get over and like over time,

I guess you get used to the
high stakes nature of it.

- When you develop an ability

and all that unconscious
processing, right?

All that part of the iceberg
that's underneath the surface

is doing all of that, right?

Is reading, you know, behavioral cues,

verbal cues and recognizing

the primacy of emotion over logic, right?

If it were all logic, it'd be different.

Okay, we're gonna talk about this thing.

I'll say things, you say things back,

even if it's politically
contentious, say so, okay,

we're gonna talk logically, but you know,

that's not the case, right?

There could be a word that raises

a certain emotion and you know,

you don't want to tread there
because the emotion will color

the person's ability to engage.

And so you're aware of all of this.

And then I think from the
perspective of all of that,

it's like standing on the shoulders

of your own internal giant, right?

That understands the, you know,

language and emotions and
body language and attunement

and history and triggering
and all of that.

And then on top of that, well,

as you're standing up on those shoulders,

you're trying to be effective, right?

And then I think that's where, you know,

effectiveness can be unilateral
or it can be together.

I mean, I think some of what emerged

from Victor Frankl's writing

after the second World War was how much

like shared humanness means to us.

How much of that can be an incentive

for survival beyond all others, right?

So the idea of are we doing something

if we're communicating unilateral,

like I want information from you

or I want you to do a certain thing

when we're done talking, right?

Done communicating.

That's a very unilateral
type of effectiveness,

which can make sense.

Sometimes I want
information out of a patient

because I wanna know
what to do next, right?

So it doesn't have to always be negative,

but it can also be a tool
of manipulation, right?

If someone who say, coming
from envy or narcissism,

I want to communicate with
you in a way that makes you

do what I want you to do, right?

Different from that is where
it's a shared communication

where, you know, there's like an umbrella,

so to speak over us and
we're doing something

that can only happen
together because we're us,

we're each person, right?

And we come together to do
something that's a shared

effectiveness like I think we're doing now

of like elucidating

and pursuing thoughts
and getting ideas out.

And I think the best situations

are shared effectiveness situations.

'Cause you call upon the resourcefulness

and the internal resources of both people.

- But you, especially with strangers,

especially when it's not
labeled a therapy session.

You kind of actually stumble
into that cooperative state.

Like you have to organically
develop a trust together

and almost lose yourself.

Ultimately, I do, I think
you put it really nice,

I think successful conversations,
even when it's with, like,

even if it's like with
world leaders or magicians,

people that operate in
the space of reason,

the most successful
conversation will ultimately

be in the layer, in the
landscape of emotion.

Like that's where the
interesting stuff will happen.

That's where you'll discover anything,

and that's where you get to actually meet,

to start getting an
understanding of each other

or what you actually mean even by

the statements that are supposed

to be kind of rationally based.

It's like you lose yourself,

you lose yourself in the way you do

when you're children and you're
just not shooting the shit

about whatever topic and
you just forget yourself.

Forget the-

- Lose yourself in the context, right?

- Yeah, where you kind of
plug into the unconscious mind

a little bit and you get
to speak maybe indirectly,

but to the things that really drive you

to the thing that really, to the things,

to the emotions, I suppose,

that underlie your worldview.

I feel like that's where
productive conversations

can happen,

whether it's a patient or just
a stranger you're talking to

at a bar about geopolitics.

You mentioned Victor Frankl.

What do you make of his work,
"Man Search for Meaning"?

What are like the lessons
you draw from his work

of him as a psychologist,

but also from that very
powerful work that reflects

on his experience in a
Nazi concentration camp.

- Yeah.

I think that it was almost
a profound reinvention

of humanness, right?

After something so awful,

so bleak and so despairing to speak anew

about shared humanness, human connection.

Meaning compassion.

That I think it was an
intellectual direction

that was adorned with all
of the emotions that we need

to adorn the logic with in order

to make real change in the world.

And I think that his work
has fueled, you know,

so many branches have come
from, you know, from his work,

the existential
psychotherapy and its place

in helping human activities today, right?

A trend away from the idea that,

that we are all quite isolated
and that what's going on

between us is all very
transactional, right?

I'm putting something
out and you take it in,

you put something out,
I take it in, right?

The idea that no, there's
a difference there.

There's a shared humanness that creates

a meaning beyond the transaction.

Kinda like you were just saying

the logical stuff isn't
really that interesting

because, you know, the
logic is, there's an answer

to whatever logic is
we can do math, right?

It's where does the
surprises come in, right?

Either in terms of wonderful behavior

or destructive behavior, right?

They're coming from people's emotions.

So that's what we want to understand.

And that occurs in the context
of a person and other humans.

You know, even if it's
the conception of someone

and other humans as enemy, you know,

or it's the conception of
two people sitting together.

The idea that there's a shared humanness

and it's not all transactional,

and that he could take
that out of, you know,

a pinnacle of human tragedy and utilize it

in a way that informs us being better

as a species going forward,

I think is really monumental.

- What do you think is the role of emotion

in the human mind, in the human condition?

Because we've talked several
times in different ways

that emotion matters, and
it's a big part of who we are,

but why is it there?

Why is it useful?

What's good about it?

We almost said it's almost
like a negative thing

that we just have to live with,

but why is it also
maybe a beautiful thing?

- Well, I think you said
what's the role of emotion?

I think emotion is the king,
if we wanna use that analogy.

It's the CEO, if we wanna
use that analogy, right?

Emotion rules all,

we're taught that we're logical creatures,

but we have innumerable pieces of data

even over the course of just a day,

let alone a human experience to tell us

that is not the truth.

Is it ever logical to run
into a burning building?

No. Right?

I mean, logic's never
gonna tell when to do that.

Okay, someone you love is in the building,

the person's already sprinted halfway

to the building, right?

Emotion rules us.

And so a thought is some of
that is evolutionary, right?

That strong negative
emotion stays with us very,

very profoundly, right?

So example I'll give is if we're
hunter gatherers and like I

find a new berry and it tastes
good and it seems nutritious,

and then, and it is right?

Everybody, everything's fine.

It'd be good to remember that, right?

But if I find a new
berry and it tastes good

and it seems nutritious and we both eat it

and almost die of sickness, we
better remember that, right?

So the primacy of emotion is in us

for reasons that are about survival,

that the emotion of its
my child in that building

or my loved one is why I
don't give a damn about logic

and run into the building, right?

The emotion of,

I thought that was good
and I got really sick

and I better never forget,
is also about survival.

And the same applies to humans.

If we are from different tribes
back then, and in my tribe,

when you put your hand
out, it's a greeting.

In your tribe, if someone
puts their hand out,

it means, Hey,

I'm gonna attack you and
take your stuff, right?

Then I put my hand out
and you slug me, right?

Then it's like, I better
remember that, right?

But you see how that
can lead into, you know,

are the constructs around that?

I say, oh, people in your
tribe are violent, right?

We start then to make stories around that,

but the primacy of emotion,

whether it's berries or it's
humans who might threaten us

or it's humans we love.

I think it's hard to even look at

the anthropological
psychological literature

to look at what's out there and

I think the face validity,

that that's part of survival, right?

It's part of survival.

- Well, it's so cool that you
get also things like love,

which are not often rational
or grounded in logic and so on.

If you look like,

sort of from a transactional perspective,

a lot of times falling in love
or whether it's with friends

or friendship or romantic love,

it doesn't really make sense.

I'm still not sure what
what the hell it is

because like, I mean, it's the thing that,

it's one of the things
or love for your kids

when they're born, right?

Like that love, the parental love.

What is that, that's so cool
that we get to have the, like,

if you're looking for the,

in the menu of items
that give life meaning,

that seems like a pretty good one.

- Yeah, so my response,

you just said that gives life
meaning, my response initially

was gonna be it's the
meaning of life, right?

Because saying, okay,
emotion is about survival.

That's one part, right?

And it's a very important part, right?

If we don't survive,

then we're not there to
have emotions, right?

So yes, it's about survival,
but as important as that is,

that's the small part of it, right?

I think it is about the meaning of life

because it's about the beyond self.

And I think it relates
back to what we talked,

we're talking about the very
beginning and the sort of

levels of emergence, right?

And when we feel love, we feel happiness

because that person
feels happiness, right?

There's something that's so generative,

so creative about that.

Like, we wanna bring order
to things and we, you know,

happiness, there's consistent
with simplicity, right?

If we're healthy,

there's nothing negative to
say about our health, right?

If we have health problems,
there's a lot to say, right?

And it's emotion that pushes
us towards the goodness

that I think makes all the meaning for us.

I mean, it's interesting.

I actually, I was wondering your thoughts

about this as a scientist, right?

'Cause we accept it by and large

that we have free will, right?

We have free will,

but then we get upset that
there's not justice, right?

So, but how is it like,
if we have free will,

I could act in an unjust way
and then you're surprised or,

you know, vice versa, like why, right?

We have these thoughts
because I think because

we're rooted, we want logic to rule.

Like there's a way in which
I can understand logic,

I can can manage it, I can manipulate it.

We sort of want it to be that way.

So then we glorify logic

and then we misapply it like ideas like,

oh, I know we have free
will, but I'm now, you know,

shaking my fist at the heavens

because there's no justice, right?

And I think maybe what
we're looking for is

we should go back and look at the givens.

Like, why is there,

there's only goodness if there's justice.

I mean, that doesn't make,
I think the goodness.

Why does the goodness have
to be tied to that, right?

Maybe it goes back to the
counter entropy and the fact that

when there is something,
there is not nothing, right?

And where there is something,
there can be awareness,

there can be goodness, there
can be compassion, right?

Is it that what's really
going on is not about justice?

Yes, we have free will,

but it's that goodness creating,
shoring up, making better.

That is the meaning.

That is the good, right?

And that the evil is the
destruction as evidenced by the

fact that it's over-determined
probably a million times that

we're in this Eddie
current of counter entropy.

And we could destroy that
quite readily. Right?

And then we're nothing this like,

like everything else that we know of,

that's not us that doesn't have
the ability to do something

that's creative or constructive.

I mean, I think that that's the answer.

And I think that our
science really tells us

that that's the answer.

And I think it beckons us with ideas.

Like we know that things happen

outside of space and time, right?

I mean, they're physics
experiments, right?

Like we know this from the science of it,

yet we don't stop and look and say, wait,

is that the magic of the idea?

Einstein said, God doesn't
play dice with the universe.

I think, okay,

maybe God doesn't play dice
with the universe that quantum

and determinacy and
all of that is not just

a flip of the coin, so to speak,

but maybe it's in that indeterminacy that

we're given the opportunity
to assert ourselves, right?

To make something one way or another.

You know, maybe it's not God
playing dice with the universe,

but it's God loading
the dice in our favor.

If we'll only listen to truth,

the truth that being destructive

doesn't help or soothe anything,

even in the person who thinks
it will for themselves.

And that creativity and generative

and kindness and compassion like this is,

doesn't that seem of
analogous to the Eddie current

of counter entropy that has
us here in the first place?

And I think that's where I pin meaning.

And that meaning then going back

to the initial question, right,

is generated in us through emotion,

through what we feel that
leads us to feel something

that is mysterious.

'Cause I don't know why I feel it.

- Yeah, in some sense the emotion

is the kind of the fuel of that
creative imperative we have.

But if you step back and look
at the tapestry a little bit,

it does seem that the destruction,

the creation of the
destruction or the yin and yang

of life, that it all works only if

the main engine is towards creativity,

but destruction also
makes way for new things.

So that's this kind of struggle.

It seems like life is struggle
between the different forces

that make up the individual
human, that make up society.

All these tensions

are necessary for growth, for development,

this kind of inner
conflict and outer conflict

are necessary for growth.

It's not just, I mean,

in some sense it's from the logic aspect.

You kind of want everything to be perfect

and just for nobody to suffer,
for everything to be perfect.

But just like we talked about with trauma,

it just seems like it's
such a big giant mess.

What is it Bukowski said,

fine, would you love and let it kill you.

There's some aspect of the
negative aspect of passion

and pursuit and obsession and the turmoil

of the pursuit of happiness,

of the creative pursuits and all of that.

I mean, that's part of life as well.

and I don't know what to do with that

from an individual perspective

in terms of figuring out
how do you live a good life?

How do you live a healthy life?

'Cause it does seem that bit of hardship

or sometimes a lot of hardship

can make a pretty interesting life.

- I think it brings us back

to the discussion that we
were having sort of before

about like, what does it mean,

like the challenges of trauma, right?

And of overcoming,

and I think here we gotta be

and careful with the language, right?

Because I would then say,
let's take destruction, right?

And separate it into two things, right?

Like one is you say destruction is like

the breaking down, the tearing
down of something, right?

Versus a process that
has malice in it, right?

So just like when we were
talking about a trauma

and no setbacks, things to
overcome, we might say, okay,

if you say, hey,

you have it harder than the next person

and you have more to overcome

or someone put a barrier in front of you

for you to overcome that,

there can be a lot of growth in that,

including the times when
you don't know if, gosh,

can I do this right?

Can I get over it? Right?

We're saying like that could be,

that's challenge and something to overcome

that's very positive.

But we're saying,

but there's no benefit of like

throwing a racial slur in there, right?

We're saying, because that's all bad.

Like, that's not even the princess.

I'm angry about that and
I'm gonna overcome that.

It's like that didn't need to be,

that didn't make anything better.

If the person sees that and says,

I'm gonna overcome that, it
makes things less worse, right?

He said, but there's no good to something

that's created as destructive when look

at forest fires like,
look controlled burns.

He said there's a forest
burning down, but that's okay.

There's some weak could
say destruction there,

there's a tearing down there,

but it's in the service of the next fire

not running through the community.

You know, the town that's
on the other side of it

that's very different than a forest fire

say started by arson, right?

So you might say they're
both a tearing down,

they're a tearing down of the forest,

but one is in the service of goodness,

even though it's hurting
the animals and the plants.

It's not all good, right?

But it's in the service of
something as opposed to something

else that's wantingly destructive.

I think there's no good
to the racial slur.

There's no good to the arson. Right?

That's destruction in a
way that's incorporating,

I think the malice of envy, the, you know,

something that's really purely,
if there's a yin and yang,

that's the destruct,
that's the destructive,

that's the badness end.

- So racial slurs is a surface
wave of a deeper thing.

And so, I mean, this is, I mean

the reason I'm bringing that
up is like, all right, well,

like you have these
discussions of censorship,

like what good does allowing racial slurs

in public communication do?

And it's like our communication
would surely be better

if we don't say bad things to each other.

But it's like,

it seems like the truth is our
communication will be better

if the amount of bad things

is a small fraction of communication.

That seems to be more true.

Because another aspect of
human nature with power,

the moment you start censoring

and removing bad words that
everyone agrees are bad words,

then the people at the top,

they're doing the censoring,
start getting greedy.

They start, it starts expanding.

And this is the giant mess

of human civilization
where we can't, right?

The nice piles you created
are kind of overlapping piles.

That's the gray area.

- Yeah, I agree.
- That's a problem with it.

- No, I agree completely.

There's a control of language.

There's slippery slopes there.

I think there's a very big
problem there. So I agree.

I think again, split
parsing out the language.

I'm not saying, hey,

we shouldn't have racial
slurs as if, like,

let's stop saying the words.

I mean, the idea is the
premise behind it, right?

Like, you know,

the prejudice is if we could eliminate

the prejudice behind it, you know,

I was struck as said, I knew nothing,

almost nothing about medicine.

I get to medical school and
start with anatomy, right?

And it's remarkable as, you know,

to see as the bodies are being dissected,

that like, we're all humans.

Like, it doesn't matter,

it doesn't matter a any of
these things on the outside.

Like, and that's true, not
just like in our bodies,

but in our minds,

the part of the person
that's not there, right?

Because now we're trying
to learn from the body and,

you know, it shows how ridiculous it is.

If you think that we're
99 point how many nines,

you know, percent all alike genetically.

And by the way,

you only like take another 10th off

and we're all orangutans, right?

So, but somehow we have to see

these differences between us, right?

And where does that come from?

And I think that,

I believe that all comes from
envy in that classical sense

that if I don't feel good enough,

I'm gonna want someone
to feel better about.

And so there can be visual things

that that person looks different, right?

Or you think about the, you know,

I spent some time in Great Britain

and when there's a lot of conflict in

between Northern Ireland
and Ireland, right?

And you thought, wow, there's not,

there's not even a look difference, right?

You know, it's the same general you know,

religious umbrella, same ethnicity, right?

But now there's some religious difference.

And I thought, it's not me
trying to be denigrating,

you know, around the Irish conflicts,

like that's human of oh,

there's no actual difference between us.

If I don't feel good about myself,

I'm gonna find one. Right?

It's that, that I believe could go away.

It's driven by maybe the
trauma of just being alive

in the world and things can happen to us.

But we certainly promote in
the human created trauma,

people feeling not good
enough, finding differences.

There's a place for the envy to attach.

And we're off to the
races of, you know, wars.

I mean, we're talking
about the second world war

and we think what have
we learned since then

would take us a day to map out

all the wars since then, right?

Let alone for goodness sakes,

everything that's salient right now.

So we're not pretty,

we're not good at
learning from what seemed

to be some very salient lessons.

- I should mention.

One thing is that I also
know that you're interested

in Russian culture a little bit.

Churchill said,

I cannot forecast to you
the action of Russia.

It is a righto wrapped in
a mystery inside an enigma.

So what do you, are some
interesting differences between,

so this eastern part of the
world of Russia, Ukraine,

the Slavi countries,
the former Soviet Union,

all of that versus sort of the US culture.

What stands out to you from
the literature, from the music,

from the science, all that kind of stuff?

- Yeah, I think there's so much intensity.

Intensity and I guess I would say

fearlessness of expression
that I see in a slavi culture.

Maybe it's a cross cultures.

'Cause there's a different
way that expression occurs.

We say like, oh,

it's different in the
French than the Spanish,

or is different than in parts of Africa.

And I think when you take
that part of the world

for whatever reason,

and maybe it's just totally
random or maybe it's, you know,

it's aspects of geography
and experience and migration,

but there's such an intensity

and I remember like listening
to Tchaikovsky, you know,

very early on, maybe not
for the very first time,

but early on in my life,
or reading Dostoevsky

and feeling like, oh, like
Dostoevsky's, a willingness,

his ability and his willingness
to express and create

such powerful abient states
of human experience chairback

in his music.

The depths of suffering that it expresses

has always stood out to me
as a way that like with the,

if that's like the brightest
light, so to speak,

communicating information,
that that's a place to look.

And it's also a place
that resonated with me

so strongly because I think

for some people who are informative years

and having very difficult feelings, right?

Of like a depth of feeling of like fear

and how's the world gonna be?

Am I gonna be annihilated?

What do I even want?

What do I feel inside of me

to encounter that being
expressed so intensely

I found to be very, very moving.

So I don't know if that's
a good answer or not,

but I think there's an
intensity of expression

and a fearlessness.

You know, Dostoevsky wrote
about terrible things.

You know, what happens in
the person that is there

a person who is brilliant intellectually

and very persuasive and very
capable of being effective

who also just chooses to
be a child rapist, right?

I mean, he wrote about that.

He wrote about the truths of this

is what we can be as humans.

And I think there's so many
lessons in including the truth.

Like people will tend to think, oh,

evil's not very bright
or not very intelligent.

That's a way to let evil propagate, right?

Evil can be effective and
attractive and very compelling,

but evil nonetheless.

And I just think there's
a fearless willingness

to look at that and to describe
it that I see primarily

I've studied in Russian culture.

- Yeah, the fearless exploration
of this whole human drama,

definitely Dostoevsky and others since

in the 20th century and the 19th century,

have done an incredible job of that.

Some of that just like you said,

is the language, the culture.

I think that intense romanticism
is there that is almost an

over-dramatic exploration of human nature.

It can err on the side or
falter when it goes into

a kind of cynical view of life.

You know, life is suffering.

I think that also has to
do with the way you deal

with the trauma of the
world wars and so on.

This is something the different
nations throughout Europe

had to deal with that in different ways.

Some of them have channeled
into envy and resentment,

some of them channeled into

a kind of nihilism or a cynicism.

And Ultimately the intensity
of feeling is there,

which is sort of interesting to see an,

interesting how that manifests
itself in the kind of,

in the kind of governments
that builds up, you know,

there's more authoritarianism

in that part of the world.

Versus the western world
that's more focused

on the individual versus the collective.

And when more focused on the individual,

you have a propensity to
value individual rights

with democracy and so on.

And it's interesting to watch and yeah.

To reconstruct how that all came to be.

Is it in the blood, is it in the mind?

Is it in some kind of
thing that more ethereal,

a collective set of ideas that we pass

from generation to generation
between each other.

So the collective of it. Yeah.

It's fascinating to see,

but now reinvigorated because

there's conflict in
that part of the world.

You've also thought about the Cold War.

What lessons about the human
mind, about psychiatry,

psychology and about
looking at the Cold War,

can we take forward in the 21st century

so that we can avoid World War III?.

A major cold or hot war
in the 21st century.

- Well, I think unspoken
animosities are very, very,

very dangerous.

I mean, right it was a cold war.

There was fighting through proxies, right?

The superpowers were
fighting surrogate wars

through proxies,

which of course in and of
itself causes immense suffering.

But it's becomes the opposite
of an exchange of ideas

or an exchange of thought,
you know what I mean?

Even the Chris Jeff, right.

Not believing that the
kitchen could look like it did

at the world's fair, right?

And, you know, and some of

the misconceptions here
of like what things

were like in Russia, right?

It was an utter,

it was a thought that those other people

are not actually people, right?

There's an enemy society of evil,

which then paints with a broad
brush in a way that makes it

easy, too easy for the Cold War,

the war to go from being cold, right?

To having boiling over
into utter destruction.

And you know, I wrote,

it was really a true
story that when I was in,

it was still the Soviet Union,

but it was right around the
time the Soviet Union coming to

an end and had gone on a trip
for students from England.

And we got to go places that
people like hadn't gone,

you know, it foreigners hadn't
gone in many, many years.

It was just kind of the right
timing to experience that.

And like,

it really is true that someone
said on short notice to these

poor kids that like,

these group of Americans were
coming and I have a picture

somewhere of the kid in a gas mask.

Like they went under their
desks and put on gas masks

and they thought, right,
that's what I mean.

That's what...

They're taught to think about
us and we're taught to think

about them and like

now we're back in an us them right?

When, you know, we're
all trying to survive

and we we're all such, you know,

just human life is so delicate, right?

You know, let alone human happiness.

And we make these divisions
and we create this aggression

and late aggression.

We, during the Cold War,
we developed, right?

The ability to destroy the earth, right?

And then just sat looking
at one another, you know,

with further growing misunderstanding

and the opportunity for the proxy fights.

Like rather they say the
Cuban Missile Crisis,

which I know wasn't a war,

but it's an aspect of that, right?

Where we just have
ourselves wildly, you know,

at risk of destruction without
any mutual understanding.

And again, I would argue that

that is the opposite of
the counter entropy, right?

Like we are setting everything up

for less lack of communication,
lack of understanding.

How do those feelings of love
and shared humanness happen?

They don't, right?

If you separate people and
then we push ourselves more and

more and more towards
reinstating the state of entropy

that's present in the
rest of the universe.

- What advice would you
give to young people

that are fighting entropy
with all their might

so young people and
people that are wondering

how to find their way in life.

What advice would you give?

How to have a career,

how to have a life they can be proud of?

- I think starting off with
sort of first principles I like,

okay, what are my values, right?

How do I wanna live life?

Because, you know,

I'm in my early fifties and
when I was a kid, you know,

we waited for the newspaper
came in the afternoon

and then, you know,

and then we'd see some, okay,
what's going on in the world?

We'd learn something,

I'd get the West Coast
baseball scores, right?

And learn about, oh,

here's what happened in
different parts of the world.

And by and large, I and
everyone else there,

adult or child we're
like living in a reality

that was largely our
conception was largely

what was around us, right?

And now in many ways it is,

I'm not saying it's entirely
negative, of course,

that we have more information
we can sort of think globally,

so to speak, right?

But the other side of that
is so much of the world's

problems are on us all the time, right?

Like, here's this awful
thing that happened,

how many awful things happened each day

and they're right in front of us.

And there's such an immediacy to it all

that I think it can be,

it can like paralyze
us with terror, right?

And for someone

who's young and trying to make their ways,

like how do you figure your
way out in this world that

you're worried isn't
even gonna exist, right?

And then you see how propagate

the generations before you are right?

In so many ways.

And there can become, I think
a push towards extremes,

either nihilism or I'm gonna
change everything, right?

And it's like, look,

how about let's start from how do

I wanna behave in my own community, right?

Which starts with like,

how do I wanna behave
in my household, right?

What kind of neighbor do I wanna be?

I mean, it might seem
like things like that

are silly or small in comparison

to the big things, but
I don't think they are.

I think that's how, you know,

that's how we start
building foundations that

lets us tackle the big things.

And then I do find myself saying,

when I'm working with
sometimes doing therapy

with younger people

of helping them kind of
bring back their thoughts,

their strivings, their
decisions more to themselves and

living with and around
themselves more instead of in

something that becomes very theoretical

and therefore very
threatening and unnerving.

- So focusing on the people around them,

taking one small step at a
time to form deeper connections

to build something locally.

- Yeah. How do I wanna be today?

If I go into the grocery store

and the person in front
of me drops something,

you know, I can clock
in scallop as you know,

'cause I'm in a rush, right?

And I could be like that, right?

I can be like that.

I've been that way many,
many times in my life, right?

And it's never done anyone
a bit of good, including me.

Or I can realize like,

the 10 seconds aren't gonna matter.

Can I help pick that
thing up? Or just smiling?

These are the seemingly small things

that I think make the tenor of our lives.

- Yeah, I moved, I think I
mentioned to you offline,

one of the really, the main
reason I moved to Austin, Texas,

I just remembered deciding
it when I went to Walmart

and a lady said,

you look handsome in that tie

or in that suit and tie, whatever.

Like, I don't think anyone's
ever said older lady,

she was very sweet.

There's kindness in her eyes.

She said that,

I don't think anyone ever
said anything like that to me

in my entire life.

And it was just, I don't know.

It was like, wow, there's
kindness in this world.

I know this sounds ridiculous, but like.

- Does not sound ridiculous.

- And it's like those,

you could be that for somebody, right?

Go walk around in Walmart.

- Right? Think about you remember that?

And it's pivotal.

You're citing it as, Hey,

that was a big part of me moving here.

Something with the
branch point in your life

that comes from the
simple kindness, right.

Of a person who had
goodness to give, right.

Anne wasn't scared that
you're gonna be upset by it

or right.

Right, she probably didn't have

the thought that you
could be assailing, right?

Probably. She looks you,
she's got goodness to give.

It's simple to give it, it's that simple.

And it's beautiful and it's
worth more to you than like,

how many studies would be on

where's a right to live or this or that.

None of that matters.

What mattered was the freedom to be kind.

- And that's emotion,
that's not logic at all.

That's purely just human emotion

and a little bit of humanness

that little bit of connection

and then that's what makes life great.

- Which is why it's not a bad idea, right?

That you moved here that way.

Instead of one could say, well,

I can't believe you did that
instead of looking at all the

data and hiring consultants of

what's the best place to live.

But that would be wrong, right?

Like, you made a good decision, right?

Like that was good data.

It was impactful data
even in your thoughts

about how you're happy living here, right?

It's not that, oh, you discount,

you shortchange yourself

by not relying on all the logic, right?

You felt something about
the place and you felt it as

symbolized in a person and
that made the choice for you.

- It's a balance of course,

but you also have to know
yourself a little bit.

Sometimes you can find stability
and comfort and kind of

reasoning things out a little bit, maybe

as people close to me have
sometimes criticized in that I'm

a little bit too romantic where
I'll just follow the feeling

and, you know, life, you
know, there's physics,

there's a reality to this world,

and sometimes reality
doesn't allow you to flourish

if you just follow your feelings.

But there's a dance there.

And it's happiness is ultimately
fallen in that landscape of

feeling and emotion versus
facts and reason and logic.

- As you said, have their place. Right?

They have their place.

- They do, they do.

- But they're not the be all and end all.

- You're an incredible person.

Andrew Huberman is a friend
of yours is, he said,

you absolutely must talk called the,

the number of people you know

that are just incredible people.

There's just this group of
folks that somehow helped each

other flourish and grew together.

And I'm just, I'm so happy you exist.

I'm so happy you're doing
the work you're doing

and can't wait for your second book.

- Thank you.

- And thank you for talking
today. This was really cool.

- Thank you so much.

I'm proud to be among the
group of people that you cited,

proud to be their friend

and proud that you've had me on today.

Thank you so much.

- Thank you, Paul.

- Thanks for listening to this

"Everything can be taken from
a man with the last of the

human freedoms to choose one's attitude

in any given set of circumstances."

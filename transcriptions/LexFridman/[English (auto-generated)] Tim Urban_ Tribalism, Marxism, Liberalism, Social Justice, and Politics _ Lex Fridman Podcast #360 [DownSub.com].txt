of radical

um political movement of which there

will always be a lot in the country

has managed to do something that a

radical movement is not supposed to be

able to do in the U.S which is they've

managed to hijack institutions all

across the country and hijack medical

journals and universities and

you know the ACLU you know saying all

the you know activist organizations and

non-profits and many tech companies and

the way I view a liberal democracy is it

is that it is is a bunch of these

institutions that were that were trial

and error crafted over you know hundreds

of years

and they all rely on trust public trust

and there's certain kind of feeling of

unity that actually is critical to a

liberal democracy's functioning and with

I see this thing is as a parasite on

that that whose goal is and I'm not

saying each by the way each individual

in this is I don't think they're bad

people I think that it's it's the

ideology itself has the property of its

goal is to tear apart the pretty

delicate workings of the liberal

democracy and Shred the critical lines

of trust

the following is a conversation with Tim

Urban his second time in the podcast

he's the author and illustrator of the

amazing blog called wait but why and as

the author of a new book coming out

tomorrow called what's our problem a

self-help book for societies we talk a

lot about this book in this podcast but

you really do need to get it and

experience it for yourself it is a

Fearless insightful hilarious and I

think important book in this divisive

time that we live in the Kindle version

the audiobook and the web version should

be all available on day of publication

I should also mention that my face might

be a bit more beat up than usual I got

hit in the chin pretty good since I've

been getting back into uh training Jiu

Jitsu a sport I love very much after

recovering from an injury so if you see

marks on my face during these intros or

conversations you know that my life is

in a pretty good place

this is the Lex Friedman podcast to

support it please check out our sponsors

in the description and now dear friends

here's Tim Urban

you wrote an incredible book called

what's our problem a self-help book for

societies

in the beginning you uh present this

view of uh human history as a thousand

page book

where each page is 250 years

and it's a brilliant visualization

because almost nothing happens for most

of it so what blows your mind most about

that visualization we just sit back and

think about it it's a boring book so 950

Pages 95 of the book hunter-gatherer is

kind of doing their thing I'm sure

there's you know there's some there's

obviously some major cognitive

advancements along the way in language

and I'm sure you know the bow and arrow

comes around at some point you know so

so tiny things but it's like oh now a

400 Pages tell the next thing but then

you get to page 950 and things start

moving recorded history starts at 9.76

right right it's basically the bottom

row is when anything interesting happens

there's a bunch of Agriculture for a

while before we know anything about it

and then recorded history starts yeah 25

pages

of actual like recorded history so when

we think of prehistoric we're talking

about pages one through 975 of the book

uh and then history is Page you know 976

to 1000. if you were reading the book it

would be like epilogue a d you know the

last little 10 pages of the book and we

think of a d is super long right 2000

years the Roman Empire 2 000 years ago

like that's so long yeah human history

has been going on for over 2 000

centuries

like that is it's just it's hard to wrap

your head around

um and this is I mean even that's just

the end of a very long road like you

know uh the hundred thousand years

before that it's not like you know it's

not like that was that different so it's

just there's been People Like Us that

have emotions like us that have physical

Sensations like us

um

for for so so long and who who are they

all and what was their life like and

it's you know I think we have no idea

what it was like to be them the the

thing that's craziest about the people

of the far past is not just that they

had different lives they had different

fears they had different dangers and

different responsibilities and they

lived in tribes and everything but they

didn't know anything like we just take

it for granted that we're born on top of

this Tower of knowledge and from the

very beginning we

we know that the Earth is a ball

floating in space um and we know that

we're going to die one day and we know

that

um you know we evolved from animals and

all the those were all like incredible

you know epiphanies quite recently and

the people a long time ago they just had

no idea what was going on and like I'm

kind of jealous because I feel like it I

mean it might have been scary to not

know what's going on but it also I feel

like would be you'd have a sense of awe

and wonder all the time and and you

don't know what's going to happen next

and once you learn you're kind of like

oh that's like it's a little Grim but

they probably had the same capacity for

Consciousness to experience the world

to wander about the world maybe to

construct narratives about the world and

myths and so on

they just had less grounded systematic

effects to play with they still probably

felt the narratives the myths they

constructed as intensely as we do oh

yeah they also fell in love they also

had friends and they had falling outs

with friends they didn't shower much

though they did not smell nice uh maybe

they did

maybe beauty is in the eye of the

beholder yeah maybe it's all like

relative so how about how many people in

history have experienced a hot shower

like almost none that's like when we're

hot showers invented 100 years ago

like less

um so like like George Washington never

had a hot shower it's like it's just

kind of weird like he he took cold

showers all the time or like

um and again we just take this for

granted but that's like an unbelievable

life experience to have a rain a

controlled little booth where it rains

hot water on your head and then you get

out and it's not everywhere it's like

contained

um that was like you know they a lot of

people probably lived and died with

never experiencing hot water maybe they

had a way to heat water over a fire but

like then it's I don't know it's just

like there's a there's so many things

about our lives now that are completely

just total anomaly it makes me wonder

like what is the thing they've noticed

the most I mean the sewage system like

it doesn't smell in cities so

what does the sewer system do I mean it

gets rid of waste efficiently Etc we

don't have to confront it both with our

with any of our senses and that's

probably wasn't there I mean what else

plus all the medical stuff associated

with yeah I mean how about the disease

yeah how about the the Cockroaches and

the rats and the and the disease and the

the plagues and you know and and then

when they got so they they caught more

diseases but then when they caught the

disease they also didn't have treatment

for it so they often would die or they

would just be in a huge amount of pain

they also didn't know what the disease

was they didn't know about microbes that

was this new thing the idea that these

tiny little animals that are causing

these diseases so what did they think

you know in the the Bubonic plague you

know and the black death

um the 1300s people thought that it was

an act of God because you know God's

angry at us because why would you know

why would you not think that if you

didn't know what it was

um and so the crazy thing is that these

were the same primates so I do know

something about them I know in some

sense what it's like to be them because

I'm a human as well and to know that

this particular primate that I know what

it's like to be experienced such

different things it's and and like this

isn't our life is not the life that this

primate has experienced almost ever so

it's just uh it's a bit strange I don't

know I I have a sense that we would get

acclimated very quickly like if we threw

ourselves back a few thousand years ago

it would be very uncomfortable at first

but the whole hot shower thing you'll

get used to it after a year you would

not even like miss it because uh was

there's a few uh trying to remember

which book that talks about hiking that

Appalachian Trail

but you kind of miss those hot showers

but I have a sense like after a few

months after a few years well you use

your scale recalibrates yeah yeah I was

saying the other day to a friend that

whatever you used to you start to think

that oh that the people that have more

than me are more fortunate like it just

sounds incredible I would be so happy

but you know that's not true because you

experience what would happen is you

would you would you would get these new

things or you would you would get these

new opportunities and then you would get

used to it and then you would this the

hedonic treadmill you'd come back to

where you are and likewise though

because you think oh my God what if I

had to you know have this kind of job

that I never would want or I had this

kind of marriage that I never would want

you know what if you did you would

adjust and you get used to it and you

might not be that much less happy than

you are now so on the other side of the

you being okay going back you know you

we would survive if we had to go back

um you know we'd have to learn some

skills and but but we would buck up and

you know people have gone to war before

that were in the you know shopkeepers

the year before that they were in the

trenches the next year

but on the other hand if you brought

them here

you know I always think it'd be so fun

to just bring forget the hunter

gatherers bring a 1700s person here and

tour them around take them on an

airplane and show them your phone and

all the things it can do show them the

internet show them the grocery store

imagine taking them to A Whole Foods

likewise I think they would be

completely awestruck and on their knees

crying tears of joy and then they'd get

used to it and they'd be a complaining

about like they don't you don't have

these oranges in stock is like you know

and that's you know the grocery store is

a tough one to get used to like when I

when I first came to this country the uh

the abundance of bananas was the thing

that struck me the most or like

fruits in general but food in general

but banana somehow struck me the most

that you could just eat them as much as

you want that took a long time for me

probably took several years to really

like get get acclimated to that is that

why didn't you have bananas uh the

number of bananas fresh bananas I don't

that that wasn't available bread yes

bananas no

yeah it's like we don't even know what

to have like we don't even know the

proper levels of gratitude yeah you know

walking around the grocery store I don't

know to be like the bread's nice but the

bananas are like we're so lucky I don't

know I'm like oh I could have been the

other way I have no idea well it's

interesting then where we point our

gratitude

in the west in the United States

probably

do we point it away from materialist

possessions towards or do we just Aspire

that to do that towards other human

beings that we love because in the East

and the Soviet Union growing up poor is

having food is the gratitude

having transportation is gratitude

having warmth and shelters gratitude

and now but see within that the Deep

gratitude is for other human beings it's

the Penguins huddling together for

warmth in the cold I think it's a person

by person basis I mean I'm sure yes of

course in the west we will on average

feel gratitude towards different things

or maybe a different level of gratitude

maybe we feel less gratitude than some

than countries that

um you know obviously I think the

easiest that the person that's most

likely to feel gratitude is going to be

someone who's on who's whose life

happens to be one where they just move

up up throughout their life a lot of

people in the greatest Generation you

know people who were born in the 20s or

whatever and a lot of the Boomers too

the story is the greatest Generation

group dirt poor and they often ended up

middle class and the Boomers some of

them started off middle class and many

of them ended up quite wealthy and I

feel like that life trajectory

is naturally going to

Foster gratitude right

um because you're not going to take for

granted these things because you didn't

have them

um you know I didn't go out of the

country really in my childhood very much

um you know like you know we traveled

but it was to Virginia to see my

grandparents or Wisconsin to see other

relatives or you know maybe Florida

after going on to the beach and then I

started going out of the country like

crazy in my 20s because I I really you

know

okay my favorite thing and I feel like

because I if I had grown up always doing

that it would have been another thing

I'm like yeah that's just something I do

but I I still every time I go to a new

country I'm like oh my God this is so

cool and in another country this thing

I've only seen on the map I'm like I'm

there now and so I feel like it it it's

a lot of times it's a product of what

you didn't have and then you suddenly

had but I still think it's Case by case

in that there's a there's like a meter

in in everyone's had you know uh that I

think on on a

at a 10 you are you're experiencing just

immense gratitude right which is a

euphoric feeling it's a great feeling

um and it's

um it makes you happy it's it's to savor

what you have to look down at the

mountain of stuff you have that you're

standing on right to look to look down

at and say oh my God I'm so lucky and

I'm so grateful for this and this and

this and I you know obviously that's a

happy exercise now when you move the

meter down to six or seven maybe you

think that sometimes but you're you're

not always thinking that

um uh because you're sometimes looking

up at this cloud of things that you

don't have and the things that they have

but you don't or the things you wished

you had or you thought you were going to

have or whatever and that's the opposite

direction to look right and and that's

the either that's that's Envy that's

yearning

um or often it's it's if you think about

your past

um it's it's grievance right and so then

you go into a one and you have someone

who feels like a complete victim they

are just a victim of the Society of the

their their their their siblings and

their parents and their their loved one

um and they are

um they're wallowing in

everything that's happened wrong to me

everything I should have that I don't

everything that has gone wrong for me

and so that's a very unhealthy mentally

unhealthy place to be

um anyone can go there you know there's

an endless list of stuff you can you it

can be aggrieved about and an endless

list of stuff you can have gratitude for

and so it's it's in some ways it's a

choice and it's a habit and maybe it's

part of how we were raised our natural

demeanor but it's such a good ex you are

really good at this by the way your

Twitter is like go on well like uh like

you're you you you were constantly just

saying man I'm lucky or like I'm I'm so

grateful for this and that's it's it's a

good thing to do because you're

reminding yourself but you're also

reminding other people to think that way

it's like we are lucky

um you know and um and so anyway I think

that scale can go from one to ten and I

think it's hard to be a ten I think

you'd be very happy if you could be but

I think trying to be above a five and

looking down at the things you have

more often than you are looking up at

the things you don't or being you know

resentful about the things that people

have wronged you and well the

interesting thing I think was an open

question but I suspect that you can

control that knob for for the individual

like you yourself can choose like the

stoic philosophy you could choose where

you are as a matter of habit like you

said but you can also probably control

that in a scale of a family of a tribe

of us of a nation of a society I mean a

lot you can describe a lot of the things

that happens in Nazi Germany and

different other parts of History through

sort of societal envy and resentment

that builds up maybe certain narratives

pick up and then they infiltrate your

mind and then now your knob goes to from

the gratitude for everything it goes to

resentment and envy and all Germany

between the two World Wars you know like

like you said the Soviet

um

kind of mentality

um so yeah and then when you're soaking

in a culture so there's kind of two

factors right it's

um

it's it's what's going on in your own

head and then what's surrounding you and

what's surrounding you kind of has

concentric circles there's your

immediate

group of people because that group of

people if they're a certain way if they

feel a lot of gratitude and they talk

about it a lot that kind of insulates

you from the broader culture because you

know the the the people are gonna have

the most impact on you are the ones

closest

but often they're all the all the

concentric circles are saying the same

thing the people around you or they're

feeling the same way that the broader

Community which is feeling the same way

as the broader country

um and you know them I think this is why

I think American patriotism

you know nationalism you know can be

tribal can be very not not a good thing

patriotism

um I think is is a great thing because

really what is patriotism I mean it's if

you love your country you should love

your fellow countrymen you know Patriot

you know that's a Reagan quote it's like

patriotism is like I think a feeling of

like

um Unity

um and but it also comes along with an

implicit kind of concept of gratitude

because it's like we are so lucky to

live in you know people you know think

it's chauvinist to say we live in the

best country in the world right and you

know yes when Americans say that no one

likes it right but actually it's not a

bad thing to think it's a nice thing to

think it thinks it's a way of saying I'm

so grateful for all the great things

this country gives to me in this country

has done and and I think you know if you

heard the Philip you know a Filipino

person say you know what the Philippines

is the best country in the world no one

in America would say that's chauvinist

they'd say awesome right because when

you're coming from someone you know

who's not American it sounds totally

fine

um but I think I think you know national

pride is actually good now again that

can quickly translate into xenophobia

nationalism and so you know you have to

make sure it doesn't go off that Cliff

but yeah there's good ways to formulate

that like you talk about we'll talk

about like high wrong progressivism

higher on conservatism those are two

different ways of

of uh embodying patriotism so you could

talk about maybe loving the tradition

that this country stands for or you

could talk about loving the people the

uh that ultimately push progress and

those are

from an intellectual perspective a good

way to represent uh patriotism we've got

to zoom out because this this graphic is

epic a lot of images in your book are

just Epic on their own is brilliantly

done but this one has uh famous people

for each of the cards

foreign

like the best of yeah uh for you by the

way good for them to be the person yeah

that that it's not that I could have

chosen lots of people for each card but

I think most people would agree you know

that's a pretty fair choice for each

each page and to good for them to be

able you know you crushed it if you can

be the person for your whole 250 year

page so well I noticed you put Gandhi

didn't put Hitler I mean there's a lot

of people gonna argue with you about

that particular last page true yes

you're right I could have I could have

put a I actually I was thinking about

Darwin there too though

um yeah exactly you really could have

put anyone anything about putting

yourself for a second yeah I should have

I should have that would have been

awesome I'm sure that would have

endeared the readers to me from right

from the beginning of the first page of

the book a little bit of a Messianic

complex going on but yeah so the list of

people just you know so these are 250

year chunks the last one being from 1770

to 2020 And So It Goes Gandhi

Shakespeare Joan of Arc Genghis Khan

Charlemagne Muhammad Constantine Jesus

Cleopatra Aristotle

it's so interesting to think about this

very recent human history that's 11

pages so it would be 27.50 almost 3 000

years just that there's these figures

that stand out and then Define the

course of human history and it's like

the create the craziest thing to me is

that like Buddha was a dude he was a guy

with like

arms and legs and fingernails that he

may be bit and like he likes certain

foods and maybe he got like uh you know

he had like digestive issues sometimes

and like he got cuts and they stung and

like he was a guy

um and he had hopes and dreams and he

probably had a big ego for a while

before he gets Buddha totally overcame

that one but like

and it's like who knows you know you

know what the myth the mythical figure

who knows how similar he was but the

fact same with Jesus like this was a

good guy like to me it's he's a primate

yeah what uh impact he was a cell first

and then a baby yeah and he was a fetus

at some point he's a dumb baby trying to

learn how to walk yeah like having

tantrum yeah um because he's frustrated

because he's in the terrible twos Jesus

was in the terrible twos who didn't

never had a tantrum let's be honest the

myth the mother was like this this

Baby's great like

wow let's figure something out it just I

mean this I mean listen hearing learning

about Genghis Khan it's incredible to me

because it's just like this was some

um Mongolian

you know herder guy who was it taken as

a slave and he was like dirt poor you

know catching rats is it you know young

teen with you know to feed him and his

mom and his I think his brother

um and it was just like

the the the odds

on when he was born he was just one of

you know probably tens of thousands of

random teen boys living in Mongolia in

the 1200s the odds of that person any

one of them being a household name today

that we're talking about

it's just crazy like what had to happen

um and for that guy to for that poor

dirt poor herder to take over the world

I don't know so history just like

continually blows my mind like you know

and here's the reason you and I are

related probably yeah no I mean we're

it's it's also that's the other thing is

that some of these dudes by becoming

King by being having a better Army at

the right time you know William the

Conqueror whatever has is in the right

place at the right time with the right

Army you know and there's a weakness at

the right moment and he comes over and

he exploits it and ends up probably

having you know I don't know a thousand

children and those children are high up

people who might be have a ton

this species is different now because of

him like if that if I forget England's

different or you know European borders

look different like like we are like we

look different and because of a small

handful of of people um you know yeah

certain when I sometimes I think I'm

like oh you know this part of the world

I can recognize someone's Greek you know

someone's Persian someone's wherever

because you know they kind of have

certain facial features and I'm like it

may have happened I mean obviously it's

that's a population but it may be that

like someone 600 years ago that looked

like that really spread their seed and

that's why the ethnicity looks kind of

like that now sorry anyway

yeah yeah do you think individuals like

that can turn the direction of History

or is that an illusion that narrative

would tell ourselves

well it's both I mean so I said William

the Conqueror right or Hitler right

it's not that Hitler was born and

destined to be great at all right I

think in a lot of cases he's um

frustrated artist with a temper who's

turning over the table in his studio and

hitting his wife and being kind of a

dick uh and a total nobody right

um I think almost all the times you

could have put Hitler baby on Earth he's

uh he's a rando right you know and maybe

he's a you know maybe sometimes he

becomes a you know some kind of you know

he uses the speaking ability because

that ability was going to be there

either way but maybe he uses it for

something else

but

um but that said I don't also do I think

you but it's not that um oh World War II

was gonna happen either way right so

it's both it's that like these

circumstances were one way and this

person

came along at the right time and those

two made a match made in in this case

hell but it makes you wonder

yes it's a match in hell but are there

other people that could have taken this

place or do these people that stand out

they're the rare spark of uh

that genius whether to take us towards

evil towards good whether those figures

singularly Define the trajectory of

humanity you know what defines the

trajectory of humanity in the 21st

century for example might be the

influence of AI might be the influence

of nuclear war negative or positive

not in the case of a nuclear war but uh

the bioengineering

nanotech

virology

what else is there maybe the structure

of governments and so on maybe the

structure of universities I don't know

there could be singular figures that

stand up and lead the way for human

there will be but I wonder if the

society is the thing that manifests that

that person or that person really does

have a huge impact I think it's probably

a spectrum where there are some cases

when a circumstance was such that

something like what happened was gonna

happen if you pluck that person from the

earth I don't know whether the Mongols

is a good example or not but maybe it

could be that if you plucked Genghis

Khan as a baby

there was because of the specific way

Chinese civilization was at that time

and the specific

you know climate you know that was that

was causing a certain kind of pressure

on the Mongols and the way they they

still had their great archers and they

had their horses and they had a lot of

the same advantages so maybe it was like

it was waiting to happen right it was

going to happen either way and uh may

not have happened to sit to the extent

or whatever so maybe or you could go the

full other direction and say actually

this was probably not gonna happen

um and you know I think World War II is

an example right I kind of think World

War II really was kind of the the work

of it of course it relied on all these

other circumstances you had to have the

resentment in German you have had the

Great Depression but like

um I think if you take Hitler out I'm

pretty sure World War One World War II

doesn't happen

well then it seems like easier to answer

these questions when you look at history

even recent history but let's look at

now let's look at I'm sure we'll talk

about social media so who are the key

players in social media Mark Zuckerberg

what's the name of the Myspace Guy Tom

Tom yeah

um there's a meme going around where

like Myspace is like the perfect social

media because no algorithmic involvement

everybody's happy and positive but also

Tom did it right yeah at the time you're

like oh man Tom only made like a few

million dollars he sucks to not be Zuck

Tom might be living a nice life right

now where he doesn't have this in

nightmare that these other people have

yeah and he's always smiling his profile

picture

and then so there's like Larry Page so

with Google that's kind of intermingled

into that whole thing into the

development of the internet Jack Dorsey

now Elon

um who else I mean there's people

playing with the evolution of social

media and to me that seems to be

connected to the development of AI and

it seems like those singular figures

will Define the direction of AI

development and social media development

with social media seeming to have such a

huge impact on our collective

intelligence it does feel in one way

like

individuals have an especially big

impact right now in that a small number

of people are pulling some big levers

um and you know there can be a little

meeting of three people at Facebook and

they come out and they come in they come

out of that meeting and make a decision

that totally changes the world right on

the other hand you see a lot of a lot of

Conformity you see a lot of you know

they all pulled the plug on Trump the

same day right

so that suggests that there's some

bigger force that is also kind of

driving them in which case it's less

about the individuals I think you know

this is what you know what is leadership

right I mean to me leadership

is the ability to move things in a

direction that the cultural forces are

not already taking things right A lot of

times people seem like a leader because

they're just kind of hopping on the

cultural wave and they happen to be the

person who gets to the top of it now it

seems like they're but actually the the

wave was already going like real

leadership is when

um is is when someone actually changes

the wave changes the shape of the wave

like I think Elon with you know SpaceX

and and with Tesla like genuinely like

shaped a wave you know maybe you could

say that EVS were actually like they

were gonna happen anyway but it's

there's no it's not much evidence about

at least happening when it did uh you

know if we end up on Mars you know you

can you can say that Elon was a genuine

like leader there and so there are

examples now like Zuckerberg definitely

has done a lot of leadership along the

way

he's also

um potentially kind of like caught in a

a storm that is happening and you know

he's one of the figures in it so I don't

know and it's possible that he is a big

shaper if the metaverse becomes a

reality if in 30 years we're all living

in a virtual world to many people it

seems ridiculous now that that was a

poor investment we talked about getting

you know 10 you know I think it was

something like a billion people with um

a VR headset in their pocket and by you

know I think 10 years from now back in

2015 so we're hyper behind that but when

I he was talking about that and honestly

I I

this is something I've been wrong about

because I I went to like one of the

Facebook conferences and tried out all

the new Oculus stuff and I was like you

know pretty early talking to some of the

you know major players there because I

was going to write a big post about it

that then got swallowed by this book but

um but I would have been wrong in the

post because in what I would have said

was that this thing is when I tried it I

was like this is you know some of them

were suck some of them make you nauseous

and they're just not that you're you

know the headsets were big and you know

but I was like the times when this is

good it is I have this feeling I haven't

had it reminds me of the feeling I had

when I first was five and I went to a

friend's house and he had Nintendo and I

and he gave me the controller and I was

looking at the screen and I pressed a

button and Mario jumped and I said I

said

I can make this something on the screen

move and the same feeling I had the

first time someone showed me how to send

an email it was like really early and

he's like you can send this and I was

like it goes I can press enter on my

computer and something happens on your

computer those were obviously you know

when you have that feeling it often

means you're you're witnessing a

paradigm shift and I thought this is one

of those things

and I still kind of think it is but it's

kind of weird that it hasn't you know

like where's the VR Revolution like yeah

I'm surprised because I'm I'm with you

my first and still instinct is this

feels like it changes everything VR

feels like it changes everything but

it's not changing anything like and a

dumb part of my brain is genuinely

convinced that this is real but then the

smart part knows it's not but that's why

the dumb part was like we're not walking

off that Cliff the smart part's like

you're on your rug it's fine the dumb

part of my brain is like I'm not walking

off the cliff so it's like it's crazy I

feel like it's waiting

for like that revolutionary person who

comes in and says I'm going to create a

headset like honestly yeah Steve Jobs

iPhone of honestly a little bit of a

Carmack type guy which is why it was

really interesting for him to be

involved with with Facebook is basically

how do we create a simple dumb thing

that's a hundred bucks but actually

creates that experience and then there's

going to be some viral killer app on it

and that's going to be the Gateway into

a thing that's going to change

everything I mean I don't know what

exactly was the thing that changed

everything with the personal computer

does that understood why that maybe

Graphics what well was the use case I

mean exactly it wasn't it wasn't the the

not 84 Macintosh like a a moment when it

was like this is actually something that

normal people can and want to use

because it was less than five thousand

dollars I think it was and I just think

it had some like Steve Jobs user

friendliness already to it that other

ones hadn't had I think Windows 95 was a

really big deal yet they I remember like

because I I'm old enough to remember the

MS-DOS when I was like kind of

remembered the command and then suddenly

this concept of like a window you drag

something into or you double click an

icon which now seems like so obvious to

us was like revolutionary because it

made it it made it intuitive so you know

I don't yeah Windows 95 was good it was

crazy yeah I forget what the big leaps

was because those Windows 2000 it sucked

and then Windows XP was good I moved to

Mac around 2004 so I stopped I sold your

soul to the devil I see well us the

people still use uh Windows and Android

uh the device in the operating system of

the people not you elitist folk with

your books

and your uh what else and success okay

uh

you write more technology means better

good times but it also means better bad

times and the scary thing is if the good

and bad keep exponentially growing it

doesn't matter how great the good times

become if the bad gets to a certain

level of bad it's all over for us can

you elaborate on this why why is there

why does the bad have uh that property

that if it's all exponentially getting

more powerful then the bat is going to

win in the end was is my misinterpreting

that no so the first thing is I noticed

a trend

which was like

the centuries the good is getting better

every Century like the 20th century was

the best Century yet in terms of

prosperity in terms of GDP per capita in

terms of life expectancy in terms of

poverty and disease and every metric

that matters the 20th century was

incredible it also had the biggest Wars

in history the biggest genocide in

history the biggest existential threat

yet with nuclear weapons right you know

it the Depression was you know probably

as big an economic so it's this

interesting thing where the stakes are

getting higher in both directions and so

the question is like if you get enough

good does that protect you against the

bat right the the the the dream and I do

think this is possible too is the good

gets so good you know have you ever read

the culture series The Ian Banks books

not yet but I get criticized on a daily

basis but some of the mutual folks we

know for not having done so lots and I

feel like a lesser man for it yes I need

to say so that that that's how I got

onto it and I read six of the ten books

um and they're great but the thing I

love about them is like it just paints

one of these

futuristic societies where the good has

has gotten so good that the bad is no

longer even an issue like basically and

the way that this this works is the AI

you know the AIS

um

are benevolent and they control

everything and so like there's one

random anecdote where they're like you

know what happens if you murder someone

in because he's still you know there's

still people with rage and jealousy or

whatever so so someone murdered someone

um first of all that person's backed up

so it's like they help to get a new body

and it's it's annoying but it's like

it's not death and secondly that person

what are they gonna do put them in jail

no no they're just gonna send a slap

drone around which is this little like

tiny you know random drone that just

will float around next to them forever

and by the way kind of be their servants

like it's kind of fun to have a slap

drone but just making sure that they

never do anything and it's like I was

like oh man it could just be everyone

could be so safe and everything could be

so like you know you want a house you

know the as will build your house

there's endless space there's endless

resources so I do think that that could

be part of our future that's part of

what excites me is like there is like

today would seem like a utopian to

Thomas Jefferson right Thomas

Jefferson's world would seem like a

Utopia to a caveman

there is a future and by the way these

are happening faster these jumps right

so the thing that would seem like a

Utopia to us we could experience in our

own lifetimes right like it's especially

a female life extension it combines with

exponential progress

um I want to get there and I think if in

that part of what makes it Utopia is you

don't have to be as scared of the the

worst bad guy in the world trying to do

the worst damage because we have

protection

but that said

um I'm not sure how that happens like

it's it's

either easier said than done Nick

Bostrom uses the example of if nuclear

weapons could be manufactured by

microwaving sand for example

we'd probably be in the Stone Age right

now because

0.001 of people would love to destroy

all Humanity right some 16 year old with

huge mental health problems who right

now goes and shoots up a school would

say oh even better I'm going to blow up

a city and now suddenly there's copycats

right and so

that's like as our technology grows it's

going to be easier for the worst bad

guys

to do and tremendous damage and it's

easier to destroy than to build so it

takes a tiny tiny number of these people

with enough power to do bad so that to

me I'm like the stakes are going up

because the the what we have to lose is

this incredible Utopia but also like

dystopia is real it happens the Romans

ended up in a dystopia they've probably

earlier thought that was never possible

like

we should not get cocky and so to me

that that trend

is the exponential Tech is a

double-edged sword it's so exciting I'm

happy to be alive now overall because

I'm an optimist and I find it exciting

but it's really scary and we and and the

the the the the dumbest thing we can do

is not be scared dumbest thing we can do

is get cocky and think well my life is

always the last couple Generations

everything's been fine

stop that

what's Your Gut what percentage of

trajectories take us towards the as you

put unimaginably good future versus

unimaginably bad future is I think are

you as an optimist it's really hard to

know I mean it all like you know one of

the things we can do is look at history

and

on one hand there's a lot of stories

actually listening to a great podcast

right now called the fall of

civilizations

um and it's literally every episode is

like you know a little like two hour

Deep dive into some civilization some

are really famous like the Roman Empire

some are more obscure like the the Norse

in Greenland but

um but it's each one is so interesting

but what's

it's I mean there's a lot of

civilizations that had their Peak

there's always the peak right when

they're thriving and they're they're Max

size and and and they have their

waterways and they have their civilized

and it's representative and it's fair

and whatever I'm not not always but it's

it's uh the peak is a great you know if

I could go back in time you know it's

not that you don't you know the farther

you go back the worse it gets no no you

want to go back to a civilization during

I would go to the Roman Empire in the

year 100. it sounds great right you

don't want to go to the Roman Empire in

the year 400. we might be in the peak

right now here whatever honestly I I

think about like the 80s you know the

70s the 80s Here We Go the music no no

it's so much better no the 80s culture

is so annoying it's just like I'm I'm

when I re when I listen to these things

I'm thinking you know the 80s and 90s

America the 90s was popular if people

forget that now like Clinton was a

superstar around the world Michael

Jordan was exported internationally then

basketball was everywhere suddenly you

had like music the sports whatever it

was a little probably like the 50s you

know you're coming out of the World War

and the depression before it was like

this kind of like everyone was in a good

mood kind of time you know it's like a

finish a big project and it's Saturday

it was like I feel like the 50s was kind

of like everyone was having it you know

the the

um 20s I feel like everyone was in good

mood randomly

um then the the 30s everyone was in a

bad mood

um but the 90s I think we'll look back

on it as a time when everyone was in a

good mood and it was like you know again

of course at the time it doesn't feel

that way necessarily but I look at that

I'm like maybe that was kind of

America's Peak and like no maybe not but

like it hasn't been popular since really

worldwide um it's gone in and out

depending on the country but like it

hasn't reached that level of like

America's awesome around the world and

the political you know situations gotten

you know really ugly and you know maybe

it's social media maybe who knows but I

I wonder if it'll ever be a simple

and and positive as it was then like

maybe we are in the in the you know it

feels a little like maybe we're in the

beginning of the downfall or not because

because these things don't just go it's

not a perfect smooth Hill it goes up and

down and up and down so maybe we're

there's another big upcoming and it's

unclear whether public opinion which is

kind of what you're talking to is uh

correlated strongly with influence as

you could say that even though America's

been on a decline in terms of public

opinion the exporting of Technology

that America has still with all the talk

of China has still been leading the way

in terms of AI in terms of social media

in terms of just basically any software

related product like chips yeah chips so

hardware and software I mean America

leads the way you could argue that

Google and Microsoft and Facebook are no

longer American companies they're

International companies but they really

are still at the you know headquarters

in Silicon Valley broadly speaking so uh

in Tesla of course and just all of its

all the technological innovation still

seems to be happening in the in the

United States although culturally

and politically

it this is not it's not it's not good

well maybe that could shift at any

moment when all the technological

development can actually be

create some positive impact in the world

yeah that can shift it with the right

leadership and so on with the right

messaging

yeah I I think um

I I don't feel confident at all about

whether no no I don't mean that I don't

mean I don't feel confident in my

opinion that we may be on the downswing

or that we may be I truly don't know

it's like I think the people

foreign

stories that are really hard to see when

you're inside of them it's like it's

like being on a beach and and running

around you know a few miles this way

I've been trying to suss out the shape

of the coastline like it's just really

hard to see the big picture you know you

get caught up in the the the micro

Stories the little tiny you know ups and

downs that are part of some bigger Trend

and and also giant Paradigm shifts

happen quickly nowadays the internet you

know came out of nowhere and suddenly

was like

you know change everything so there

could be a changed everything thing on

the way it seems like there's a few

candidates for it and like but but I

mean it feels like the stakes are just

High it higher than it even was for the

Romans higher than it was for because

um that we we're more powerful as a

species we have god-like powers with

technology that other civilizations at

their Peak didn't have and so I I wonder

if those high stakes and Powers will

feel laughable to people that live

humans aliens cyborgs whatever lives 100

years from now that maybe maybe are a

little like this feeling of political

and technological turmoil is is nothing

well that's the big question you could

EAS so right now you know you know the

1890s was like a super politically

contentious decade in the U.S it was

like immense tribalism

um and the newspapers were all like

lying and telling you know you know

there was a lot of like what we would

associate with today's media the worst

of it

um and it was over gold or silver being

this I don't know it was very it's

something that I don't understand but

the point is it was a little bit of a

blip right it happened it felt it must

have felt like the end of days at the

time and then now we most people don't

even know about that uh versus you know

again the Roman Empire actually

collapsed and so the the question is

just like is yeah you know will in 50

years will this be like or like

McCarthyism oh they had like uh oh that

was like a crazy few years in America

and then it was fine

um or is this the beginning of something

really big and then that's what

well I wonder if we can predict uh what

the big thing is at the beginning it

feels like we're not we're just here

along for the ride and at the local

level and at every level of trying to do

our best how do we do our best what's

the that's the one thing I know for sure

is that we need to have our wits about

us and do our best and the way that we

can do that you know we have to be as

why is this possible Right to proceed

forward and wisdom

ever is an emergent property of

discourse so your proponent of wisdom

versus stupidity because you can make an

uh uh I can still man the case for

stupidity

do it I probably can't but there's some

I think wisdom and you talk about this

can come with a false confidence

arrogance I mean you talk about this in

the book that's too easy that's not

wisdom then if you're being arrogant

you're being unwise unwise yeah you know

I think I think wisdom is doing what

people a hundred years from now with the

hindsight that we don't have would do if

they could come back in time and they

knew everything it's like how do we

figure out how to have hindsight when we

actually are not what if stupidity is

the thing that people from 100 years

from now will see us wise

being naive and uh trusting everybody

maybe that well then you get lucky then

then you you know then maybe you get to

a good a good future by stumbling upon

it

um but ideally you you can get there

like I think a lot of we America the

great things about it are a product of

the wisdom of previous Americans you

know the Constitution was a pretty you

know pretty wise system to set up

there's not much stupid stumbling around

well there is I mean with the Huskies uh

the idiot Prince Michigan and uh

Brothers karmazov there's uh uh aliosha

you err on the side

of love

and almost like a naive trust in other

human beings and that turns out to be at

least in my perspective and long term

for the success of the species is

actually wisdom it's a compass we don't

know it's because you're in the fog in

the fog it's a compass yeah

love is a compass okay but but here's

the thing so I think we should have a

compass is nice but you know what else

is nice is a flashlight in the fog that

can help you can't see that far but you

can see oh you can see four feet ahead

instead of one foot and that to me is

discourse that is open vigorous like

discussion in a culture that Fosters

that is how the species is how the the

the the the American citizens as a unit

can be

as wise as possible can maybe see four

feet ahead instead of one foot ahead

that said uh Charles Bukowski said that

love is a fog that Fades with the first

light of reality so I don't know how

that works out but I feel like there's

intermixing of metaphors that works okay

uh you also write that quote as the

authors of the story of us which is this

thousand page book

we have no mentors no editors no one to

make sure it all turns out okay it's all

in our hands this scares me but it's

also what gives me hope if we can all

get just a little wiser together it may

be enough to nudge the story onto a

trajectory that points towards an

unimaginably good future

do you think we can possibly Define what

a good future looks like

I mean this is uh the problem with that

we ran into with Communism

of thinking of utopia

of having a

deep confidence about what a utopian

world looks like

well it's a deep confidence that was a

deep confidence about the instrumental

way to get there it was that you know I

think a lot of us can agree that if

everyone had everything they needed and

we didn't have disease or poverty and

people could live as long as they wanted

to and choose when to die

and there was no existential major

existential threat because we control I

think almost everyone can agree that

would be great that communism is a that

was they said this is the way to get

there and that is

that that's a different question you

know so the the unimaginably good future

I'm PR I'm picturing I think a lot of

people would picture and I think most

people would agree now not everyone

there's a lot of people out there who

would say humans are the scourge on the

earth and we should degrowth or

something but I think a lot of people

would agree that you know just again

take Thomas Jefferson bring him here he

would see it as utopia for obvious

reasons for the the medicine the the

food the transportation

um just how uh the quality of life and

the safety and all of that so

extrapolate that forward for us now we

were Thomas Jefferson you know what's

the equivalent

that's what I'm talking about and the

and the big question is I actually don't

I I don't try to say here's the way to

get there here's the actual specific way

to get there I try to say how do we have

a flashlight so that we can together

figure it out like how do we give

ourselves the best chance of figuring

out the way to get there and I think

part of the problem with with Communists

um and people is ideologues is that

they're they're way too overconfident

that they know the way to get there and

and it's it becomes a religion to them

this solution and then you're not you

can't update once you have a solution as

a religion and so I felt a little

violated when you said Communists and

stare deeply into myself

um

in this book you've developed a

framework for how to fix everything

um it's called the latter can you

explain it okay it's not a framework for

how to fix everything just I would never

say that I'll explain it to Tim Urban at

some point okay how this humor thing

works yeah framework of uh how to think

about collaboration between humans such

that we could fix things I think it's a

compass it's like uh it's like a

it's a ruler that we can once we look at

it together and see what it is we can

all say oh we want to go to that side of

the ruler sure not this side

um and so it gives us a direction to go

and so what are the parts of the ladder

so I have these two characters this

orange guy this primitive mind is this

is our software that is the software

that was in a 50 000 BC person's head

that was specifically optimized for to

help that person survive in that world

and not even not just not really survive

but help them pass their genes on in

that world

um

and

civilization happened quickly and brains

changed slowly and so that unchanged

dude is still running the show in our

head

um and I use the example of like

Skittles

like why do we eat Skittles it's trash

it's obviously bad for you and it's

because

the Primitive mind

in the world that it was programmed for

there was no Skittles and it was just

fruit and you know and and if there was

a dense chewy Sweet fruit like that it

meant you just found like a calorie Gold

Mine energy energy take it take it eat

as much as you can gorge on it hopefully

you get a little fat that would be the

dream and now we're so good with energy

for a while we don't have to stress

about it anymore so today Mars Inc is

clever and says let's not sell things to

people's higher Minds who's the other

character let's sell the people's

primitive Minds primitive minds are dumb

and let's trick them into thinking this

is this new this this thing you should

eat and then they'll eat it now Mars Inc

is a huge company actually just a little

real quick see you said primitive mind

and higher mind so those are the two

things that make up

this bigger mind that it that is the

modern human being yeah it's like you

know it's not perfect obviously there's

a lot of crossover um there's people who

will yell at me for saying there's two

minds and you know that but to me it's

just still a useful framework where you

have this software that has making

decisions based on a world that you're

not in anymore and then you've got this

other character I call it the higher

mind and it's the part of you that knows

that skills are not good and can

override the Instinct and the reason you

don't always eat Skittles is because the

higher Minds says no no no we're not

doing that because that's bad and I know

that right now you can apply that to a

lot of things the higher Minds the one

that knows I shouldn't procrastinate the

Primitive Minds the one that wants to

conserve energy and not do anything icky

and you know can't see the future so he

procrastinates that you know you can

apply this no I in this book apply it to

um

to how we form our beliefs is one of the

ways and then eventually the politics

and political movements but like

if you think about what well what's the

equivalent of the Skittles tug of war in

your head for how do you form your

beliefs

um

and it's that the Primitive mind in the

world that it was optimized for

um it wanted to

feel conviction about its beliefs it

wanted to be sure that it was

um I wanted to feel conviction and it

wanted to agree with the people around

there didn't want to stand out it wanted

to to perfectly agree with the tribe

about the tribe's sacred beliefs right

and so there's a big part of us that

wants to do that that doesn't like

changing our mind it feels like it's

part of our the Primitive mind

identifies with beliefs feels like it's

a threat a physical threat to you to

your primitive mind when you change your

mind or when someone disagrees with you

in a smart way so there's that huge

force in us which is confirmation bias

that's where that comes from it's it's

this this desire to keep believing what

we believe and this desire to also fit

in with our beliefs to believe what the

people around us believe and that can be

fun in some ways we all like the same

sports team and we're all super into it

and we're all gonna be biased about that

call together I mean that it's not

always bad but um it's not a very smart

way to be and it you're actually you're

working kind of for those ideas those

ideas are like your boss and you're

working so hard to keep believing those

those ideas are you know a really paper

comes in that you read that that

conflicts with those ideas and you will

do all this work to say that paper is

[ __ ] because

you're a faithful employee of those

ideas now the higher mind to me the same

party that can override the Skittles can

override this and can and can search for

something that makes a lot more sense

which is Truth uh because what rational

being wouldn't want to know the truth

who wants to be delusional and so

there's this tug of war because the

higher mind doesn't identify with ideas

why would you it's an experiment you're

doing it's a mental model and if someone

can come over and say you're wrong you'd

say where show me show me and if they

point out something that is wrong and

say oh thanks oh good I just got a

little smarter right you're not going to

identify with the thing go yeah kick it

see if you can break it if you can break

it it's not that good right so there's

both of these in our heads and there's

this tug of war between them uh and

sometimes you know if you're telling me

about something with AI I'm probably

gonna think with my higher mind because

I'm not identified with it but if you go

when you criticize the ideas in this

book or you criticize my religious

beliefs or your criticize I might have a

harder time because the Primitive mind

says no no those are our special ideas

and so yeah so that's that's one way to

use this ladder is like it's a spectrum

you know at the top the higher mind is

doing all the thinking and then as you

go down it becomes more of a tug of war

and at the bottom the Primitive mind is

in total control and this is distinct as

you show from the spectrum of ideas so

this is how you think versus what you

think and those are distinct those are

different dimensions we need we need a

vertical axis we have all these

horizontal axes Left Right Center or you

know you know this opinion all the way

to this opinion but it's like

what's much more important than where

you stand is how you got there right and

how you think so this helps if if I can

say this person's kind of on the left or

on the right but they're up high I think

I think in other words I think they got

there using evidence and reason and they

were willing to change their mind now

that means a lot to me what they have to

say if I think they're just a tribal

person and I can predict all their

beliefs from hearing one because it's so

obvious what political beliefs that

person's views are irrelevant to me

because they're not real they didn't

come from information they came from a

tribe's kind of you know sacred Ten

Commandments I really like the comic you

have in here but with the boxer uh this

is the best boxer in the world wow cool

who has he beaten no one he's never

fought anyone then how do you know he's

the best boxer in the world I can just

tell now I mean this connects with me

and I think with a lot of people just

because in martial arts it's especially

kind of true that this is this whole

legend about different martial artists

and that kind of would construct like

action figures like you know thinking

that uh Steven Seagal is the best

fighter in the world or Chuck Norris But

Chuck Norris is actually backed up he's

done really well in competition but

still the ultimate test for particularly

for martial arts is what we now know is

uh mixed martial arts UFC and so on and

that's the actual scientific testing

ground some meritocracy yeah exactly I

mean there's within certain rules and

you can criticize those rules like this

doesn't actually represent the broader

combat that you would think of when

you're thinking about martial arts but

reality is you're actually testing

things and that's when you realize that

Aikido and some of these kind of woo-woo

martial arts in their certain

limitations don't work in the way you

think they would in the context of

fighting I think this is one of the

places where everyone can agree which is

why it's a really nice comic because

then you start to talk about

map this onto ideas that people take

personally it starts becoming a lot more

difficult to um

to basically highlight that we're

thinking with uh not with our higher

mind but without primitive mind

yeah I mean if if I'm thinking with my

higher mind and now here is you can use

different things for an idea as a

metaphor so here the metaphor is a boxer

yeah

for and for one of your conclusions one

of your beliefs and

if I'm if I'm if I'm if all I care about

is truth and up in other words for the

that means all I care about is having a

good boxer

I would

say go go yeah try see if this person's

good go go in other words I would get

into arguments which is throwing my

boxer out there to fight against other

ones

um and if I think my argument's good by

the way I love boxing if I if I think my

guy is is amazing you know Mike Tyson

I'm thinking oh yeah bring it on who

wants to come see I bet no one can beat

my boxer I love a good debate right in

that case

now what would you think about my boxer

if not only had was I telling you he was

great but he's never boxed anyone but

then you said okay well your idea came

over to try to punch him and I screamed

and I said what are you doing that's

violence and you're you're in your and

you're an awful person and I don't want

to be friends with you anymore because

you you would think this boxer obviously

sucks and or at least I think it sucks

deep down because uh why would I be so

empty anyone note boxing aloud you know

people so I I think if you're in so this

I call this a ladder right if you're in

low wrong land you know whether it's a

culture or whatever a debate an argument

when someone says no that's totally

wrong uh what you're saying about that

and here's why you're actually being

totally biased

it sounds like a fight people are gonna

say oh wow we got in like a fight it was

really awkward like are we still friends

with that person because that's not a

culture or boxing it's a culture where

you don't touch each other's ideas

that's just that's insensitive versus an

in a night in a you know a high rung

culture uh it's sport that's I mean look

at every one of your podcasts your your

agree whether you're agreeing or

disagreeing the tone is the same it's

not like oh this got awkward it's like

it's it's the tone is identical because

you're just playing intellectually

either way because it's a good high

wrong space at his best at his best but

people do take stuff personally and then

that's actually one of the skills of

conversation just as a fan of podcast is

when you sense that people take a thing

personally you have to like there's sort

of methodologies and little paths you

can take to like calm things down like

go around don't don't take it as a

violation of like you're trying to suss

out which of their ideas are sacred to

them yeah and which ones are uh bring it

on and sometimes it's actually I mean

that's the skill of it I suppose that

sometimes it's a certain wordings

in the way you challenge those ideas are

important you can you can challenge them

indirectly and then together walk

together in that way because they're

what I've learned

is people are used

to their ideas being attacked in a

certain way in a certain Tribal Way and

if you just avoid those like for example

if you have political discussions and

just never mention left or right or uh

Republican and Democrats none of that

just talk about different ideas and and

avoid certain kind of triggering words

you can actually talk about ideas versus

falling into this

path that's well established through

battles that people have previously

fought when you say triggering I mean

who's getting triggered the Primitive

mind so what you're trying to do what

you're saying in this language is how do

you have conversations with other

people's higher Minds almost like

Whispering without waking up the

perimeters Criminal Mind as they're

sleeping right and as soon as you say as

soon as you say something the left

primitive mind gets up and says what

what are you saying about the left and

now now that everything goes off the

rails uh what do you make of conspiracy

theories under this framework of the

latter so

here's the thing about conspiracy

theories is that

once in a while they're true right so

because sometimes there's a natural

conspiracy actually humans are pretty

good at real conspiracies secret things

uh and then you know I just watched the

maid off doc

um great new Netflix stock by the way

um and

um so the question is

how do you create a system that is good

at you put the conspiracy theory in and

it either goes e or it says this is

interesting let's keep exploring it like

how do you put how do you do something

that it can how do you assess and so

again I think the hiron culture

is really good at it because a real

conspiracy you're what's going to happen

is you put it it's like a little machine

you put in the middle of the table and

everyone starts firing darts at it or

bow and arrow or whatever and everyone

starts kicking it and trying to and

almost all conspiracy theories they

quickly crumble right because they

actually you know you know Trump's

election one is and I actually dug in

and I looked at like every claim that he

or his team made and I was like

all of these none of these hold up to

scrutiny none of them I was open-minded

but none of them did so that was one

that as soon as it's open to scrutiny it

crumbles

the only way that conspiracy can stick

around in a community is if

it is a culture where that's being

treated as a sacred idea that no one

should kick or throw a dart at because

if we throw a dart it's going to break

so it's being it's and so the what you

want is this is a culture where no idea

is sacred anything can get thrown out

and so I think that then what you'll

find is that 994 out of 100 conspiracy

theories come in and they fall down the

other maybe four of the others come in

and there's something there but it's not

as Extreme as people say and then maybe

one is a huge deal and it's actually a

real conspiracy well isn't there a lot

of gray area and there's a lot of

mystery isn't that where the conspiracy

theories seep in so uh it's great to

hear that you've really looked into the

the the Trump election fraud claims

but aren't they resting on a lot of kind

of gray area like fog basically saying

that there is dark Forces in the shadows

that are actually controlling everything

I mean the same thing with uh maybe we

can there's like safer conspiracy

theories more less controversial ones

like have we landed on the moon right

the United States ever land on the Moon

there's you know you like the reason

those conspiracy theories work is you

could construct there's incentives and

motivation for faking the moon landing

there's a lot of

um there's a there's very little data

supporting the moon landing like that's

very public and kind of looks fake space

and that would be a big story if it

turned out to be fake that's the art

that's that would be the argument

against it like our people really as a

collective going to hold on to a story

that big

um yeah so that but but there's a lot

that the reason they work is there's

mystery yeah it's a great documentary

called behind the curve about flat

earthers and one of the things that you

learn about flat earthers is they

believe

all the conspiracies not just the Flat

Earth they're they're convinced the moon

landing is fake they're convinced 911

was an American con job

they're convinced you know that name a

conspiracy and they believe it and so

it's so interesting is that

I think of it as a um

as a skepticism Spectrum yeah so on one

side you it's like a filter in your head

a filter in your in the beliefs section

of your brain on one end of the spectrum

you are gullible perfectly gullible you

believe anything someone says right on

the other side you're paranoid you think

everyone's lying to you right

everything's everything is false nothing

that anyone says is true right so

obviously those aren't good places to be

um now the healthy place I think that

that the so so I think the healthy place

is to be somewhere in the middle and but

also you can learn to trust certain

sources and then you know you don't have

to do as much apply as much skepticism

to them and so here's what

like and when you start having a bias

just so you have a political bias

when your side says something you you

will find yourself moving towards the

gullible side of the spectrum you read

an article written that's that supports

your views you move to the gullible side

of the spectrum and you just believe it

and you don't have any where's that

skepticism that you normally have right

and then you move and then you soon as

soon as it's the other person talking

the other team talking you move to the

skeptical the the closer to the to the

you know denial paranoid side now

flat earthers are the extreme they are

either at 10 or 1.

so it's like it's so interesting because

they're the people who are saying ah nah

I won't believe you I'm not gullible no

everyone else is gullible about the moon

landing I won't and then yet when

there's this evidence like oh because

you can't see Seattle you can't see the

buildings over that Horizon and you

should which isn't true you should be if

it were or if the Earth around you

wouldn't be able to see them therefore

it's so suddenly they become the most

gullible person here any theory about

the earth flat they believe it it goes

right into their beliefs so they're

actually jumping back and forth between

refuses to believe anything and believe

anything and so they're the extreme

example but I think when it comes to

conspiracy theories the people that get

themselves into trouble

are the ones who they they become really

gullible when they hear a conspiracy

theory that kind of fits with their

world view and they likewise when

there's something that's kind of

obviously true and it's not a big lie

they will actually uh they'll they'll

think it is they they just tighten up

their kind of skepticism filter and and

so yeah so I I think the healthy places

to be is where you are not because you

also don't want to be the person who

says every conspiracy you hear the word

conspiracy theory and it sounds like a

like a synonym for like quack job crazy

Theory right so yeah so I I think yeah I

think it's be somewhere in the middle of

that spectrum and to learn to fine tune

it which is a tricky place to operate

because you kind of have to every time

you hear a new conspiracy theory you

should approach it with an open mind

and you know and also if you don't have

enough time to investigate which most

people don't kind of still have a

humility not to make a conclusive

statement that that's nonsense there's a

lot of um social pressure actually yeah

to immediately laugh off any conspiracy

theory if it's done by the the bad guys

right you will quickly get mocked and

laughed at and not taken seriously if

you give any Credence you know back the

lab leak was it was a good one where

it's like uh turned out that that was at

least very credible if not true and

that was a perfect example of one where

when it first came out and not only so

so Brett Weinstein talked about it and

then I in a totally different

conversation said something

complimentary about him on a totally

different subject

and people were saying Tim you might

have gone a little off the deep end

you're like quoting someone who is like

a lab leak person so I was getting my

reputation dinged

for complimenting on a different topic

someone whose reputation was totally

sullied because they have you know they

questioned an Orthodoxy right so it's

you see in so what what does that make

me want to do

distance myself from Brett Weinstein

that's the at least that's the incentive

that's uh and what does that make other

people want to do don't become the next

Brit Weinstein don't say it out loud

because you don't want to become someone

that no one wants to compliment anymore

right you can see the social pressure

and that's and of course when there is a

conspiracy that social pressure is its

best friend

because then they see the people from

outside are seeing that social pressure

enact like a Tim Urban becoming more and

more and more extreme to the other side

and so they're going to take the more

and more and more extreme I mean this

what what do you see that the pandemic

did

that kova did to our civilization in

that regard in the forces why was it so

divisive do you understand that

yeah so covet I you know I thought might

be you know we always you know the

ultimate example of the topic that will

unite us all is the alien attack yeah

although honestly I don't even have that

much Faith then I think there'd be like

some people are super like you know

pro-alien and some people are anti-alien

but anyway I was a surgeon to interrupt

because I was talking to a few

um astronomers and they they're the

first

folks that

maybe kind of sad in that if we discover

Life on Mars for example

that there's going to be potentially a

division over that too where half the

people will not believe that's real

well because

we we live in a current Society where

the political divide

has subsumed everything and that's not

always like that uh it goes into stages

like that we're in a really bad one

where it's I think actually in the the

book I call it like a Vortex like a like

a like a almost like a Whirlpool that

pulls

everything into it it pulls it pulls um

and so normally you'd say okay you know

immigration naturally going to be

contentious that's always political

right yeah but like

covid seemed like oh that's one of those

that will unite us all let's fight this

not human virus thing like obvious is no

no one's sensitive no one's like getting

hurt when we insult the virus like let's

all be we have this threat it's common

threat it's a threat to everyone of

every nationality in every country every

ethnicity and

and what it didn't do that at all the

whirlpool was too powerful so it pulled

coveted in and suddenly masks

if you're on the left you like them if

you're on the right you hate them and

suddenly lockdowns if you're on the left

you like them and on the right you hate

them and vaccines this is people who

forget this when when Trump first

started talking about the vaccine

Biden Harris

Cuomo they're all saying I'm not taking

that vaccine not from this CDC because

it was too rushed or something like that

but because I'm not trusting anything

that Trump says Trump wants me to take

it I'm not taking it I'm not taking it

from this CDC so

this was if Trump this Trump was almost

out of office but at the time if Trump

had been it would have been I'm pretty

sure it would have stayed Wright likes

vaccines the left blood doesn't like

vaccines instead the president switched

and all those people are suddenly saying

they were actually specifically saying

that if you you know that that like if

if you're saying the CDC is not

trustworthy that's misinformation which

is exactly what they were saying about

the other CDC and they were saying it

because they genuinely didn't trust

Trump which is fair but now and other

people don't trust the Biden CDC

Suddenly It's this kind of

misinformation that needs to be censored

so it was a sad moment because it was a

couple months at the very even a week or

so the I mean a month or so at the very

beginning when

it felt like a lot of our other

squabbles were kind of like oh I feel

like they're kind of irrelevant right

now yeah and then very quickly the

whirlpool sucked it in and and

in a way where I think it damaged the

reputation of these a lot of the the

Trust In A lot of these institutions for

the long run but there's also an

individual psychological impact it's

like a vicious negative feedback cycle

where they were deeply affected on an

emotional level and people just were not

their best cells

that's definitely true yeah I mean

talk about the Primitive mind I mean

what one thing that we've been dealing

with for our whole human history is

pathogens yeah and it's it's emotional

right it it brings out you know there's

really interesting studies where like

if

they they studied the the the the

phenomenon of disgust which is one of

these like

you know smiling is universal you don't

have to ever translate a smile right

certain you know you know throwing your

hands up when you're when your sports

team wins it's Universal because it's

part of our we're coding and so is

disgust to kind of make this like you

know face where you wrinkle up your nose

and you kind of put out your tongue and

maybe even gag that's to expel expel

whatever's because it's It's the

reaction when something is potentially a

pathogen that might harm us right feces

vomit whatever

but they did this interesting study

where people

who in in two two groups the control

group you know was shown images of

um in my beginning two studies mixed up

but they were showing they were showing

images of like car crashes and like

disturbing but not disgusting and the

other one was showing like you know like

you know rotting things and just just

things that were disgusting and then

they were asked about immigration these

were Canadians and the group that was

had the disgust feeling going pulsing

through their body was way more likely

to prefer like immigrants from White

countries

and the group that was had been showing

car accidents they were they still

preferred the groups from White

countries but much less so and so what

what does that mean it's because with

the disgust impulse makes us scared of

you know sexual practices that are

foreign of ethnicities that are not look

they don't look like us of of it's still

xenophobia so it's ugly it's this really

ugly stuff this is of course also how

you know the the Nazi propaganda with

cockroaches and uh or it was uh Rwandan

was cockroaches you know the Nazis was

rats and you know

it's it's specifically it's a

dehumanizing emotion so

anyway we were we were we were talking

about

um covid but I think it does it Taps

deep into like the human psyche in it

and it's I don't think it brings out our

I think like you said I think it brings

out an ugly side in US

you describe an idea lab as uh being

opposite of echo Chambers

so we know what Echo Chambers are and

you said like there's basically no good

term for the opposite of an echo chamber

so what's an ideal lab yeah well first

of all both of these we think of an echo

chamber as like a group maybe or even a

place but it's it's a culture it's an

intellectual culture

and this goes along with the high run

low so high rung and low wrong thinking

is individual so I was talking about

what's going on in your head but this is

very connected to the Social Scene

around us and so groups will do high

rung and low rung thinking together

um basically it's collect so an echo

chamber to me is a collaborative low

rung thinking it is it's a culture where

the cool it it's based around a sacred

set of ideas and it's the coolest thing

you can do in an echo chamber culture is

talk about how great the sacred ideas

are and how bad and evil and stupid and

wrong the people are who have the other

views and this and and and and it's it's

quite boring you know it's quite boring

you know it's very hard to learn and

changing your mind is not cool in an

echo chamber culture it makes you seem

wishy-washy it makes you seem

um like you know uh like you're waffling

and you're flip-flopping or whatever it

showing conviction about the sacred

ideas in Echo chamber culture is awesome

if you're just like you know obviously

this it makes you seem smart while being

you know humble makes you seem dumb so

now flip all of those things on their

heads and you haven't you have the

opposite which is ideal lab culture

which is collaborative High wrong

thinking it's collaborative truth

finding um but it's also just it's just

a totally different vibe it's uh it's a

place where arguing is a fun thing it's

not no one's getting offended and and

criticizing like the thing everyone

believes is actually it makes you seem

like interesting like oh really like why

why do you think we're all wrong and

um expressing too much conviction makes

people lose trust in you doesn't make

you seem smart it makes you seem stupid

if you don't really know what you're

talking about but you're acting like you

do I really like this diagram of where

on the x-axis agreement on the y-axis is

decency that's in an idea lab in an echo

chamber there's only one axis it's uh

[ __ ] to non-ass hole right this is a

really important thing to understand

about the difference between you call a

decent see here about ass hoolishness

and disagreement so my college friends

we love to argue right and and no one

thought anyone was an [ __ ] for it was

just for sports sometimes we'd realize

we're not even disagreeing on something

and that would be disappointing and be

like oh I think we agree it was kind of

like sad it was like oh well there goes

the fun

and one of the members of this group has

this she brought her new boyfriend to

one of our like Hangouts and there was

like a heated heated debate you know

just just one of our typical things and

afterwards you know the next day he said

like is everything okay and she was like

what do you mean and he said like after

you know the fight and she was like what

fight and he was like you know the fight

last night and she was like and she had

to then she was like you mean like the

the arguing and he was like yeah and she

and so that's someone who is not used to

idea lab culture coming into it and

seeing it is like that was like this is

like are they still friends right and

ideal lab is nice for the people in them

because you're it individuals Thrive you

don't want to just conform that does it

makes you seem boring in an idea but you

want to be yourself you want to

challenge things you want to have a

unique brain so that's great and and you

also have people criticizing your ideas

which makes you smarter it doesn't

always feel good but you you become more

correct and smarter an echo chamber is

the opposite where it's not good for the

people and it does your learning skills

atrophy

um and uh and I think it's boring but

the thing is they also have emergent

properties so

the emergent property of an ID lab is

like super intelligence just you and me

alone just the two of us if we're

working together on something but we're

being really

um grown up about it we're disagreeing

we're not you know no one's sensitive

about anything we're going to each find

flaws in the other ones arguments that

you wouldn't have found on your own and

we're going to have a piffy double the

epiphanies right so it's almost like the

two of us together is like as smart as

1.5 it's like 50 smarter than either of

us alone right so you have this 1.5

intelligent kind of joint being that

we've made now bring the third person in

fourth person in right you see it starts

to scale up this is why science

institutions can discover relativity in

quantum mechanics and these things that

no individual human you know was going

to come up with without a ton of

collaboration because it's this giant

idea lab so it has an emergent property

of super intelligence an echo chamber is

the opposite where it has the emergent

property of

stupidity I mean has the emergent

property of a bunch of people all you

know you know paying field you know

fealty to this set of sacred ideas and

and um so you lose this magical thing

about language and humans which is

collaborative intelligence you lose it

it disappears but there is that axis of

decency which is really interesting

because you kind of painted this picture

of you and your friends arguing really

harshly but underlying that

is a basic camaraderie respect there's

there's a

all kinds of mechanisms we humans have

constructed to communicate

like mutual respect or maybe communicate

that you're here for the idea lab

version of this totally it doesn't you

don't take it you don't get personal

right you're not getting personal you're

not

um you're not taking things personally

people are respected in an idea lab and

ideas are disrespected and there's way

ways to signal that so like for with

friends you've already done the

signaling you've already established a

relationship the interesting thing is

online I think you have to do some of

that work I mean to me the sort of uh

steel Manning the other side or no uh

having empathy and hearing out being

able to basically repeat the argument

the other person is making before you

and showing like respect to that

argument I could see how you could think

that before you make a counter argument

there's just a bunch of ways to

communicate that you're here not to uh

do kind of what is it low rung you know

[ __ ] talking mockery derision but are

actually here ultimately to discover the

truth and the space of ideas and the

tension of those ideas and I I think

it's uh

I think that's a skill that we're all

learning as a civilization of how to do

that kind of communication effectively

because I think disagreement as I'm

learning on the Internet is actually a

really tricky skill like high effort

High decency disagreement like I

listened to uh there's a really good

debate podcast uh intelligent squared

and like they they can go pretty hard in

the paint the classic idea lab exactly

but like how do we map that to social

media when people like will say

um

will say well like Lex or anybody you're

not you hate disagreement you you want

to censor disagreement no

um I love intelligent Square type of

disagreement that's fun you want to

reduce [ __ ] and for me personally I

don't want to reduce [ __ ] if you know

I kind of like ask over it's like fun in

many ways but the problem is when the

[ __ ] shows up to the party they make

it less fun for the for the party that's

there for the idea lab and the other

people especially the quiet voices at

the back of the room they leave and so

all you're left is was with [ __ ]

well that Twitter political Twitter to

me is one of those parties it's a big

party where a few [ __ ] have really

sent a lot of the quiet

thinkers away yeah

um and and so so if you think about this

graph again

what

the what Twi some place like Twitter

um a great way to get followers is to be

an [ __ ] with a certain you know

pumping a certain ideology you'll get a

huge amount of followers and for those

followers and the followers you're gonna

get the people who like you know not the

people who like you

are probably going to be people who are

really thinking with their primitive

mind because they're seeing your your

being you're being an [ __ ] but

because you agree with them they love

you and they think they don't see any

problem with how you're being yeah they

don't see the [ __ ] this is a

fascinating thing people because look

because look at the thing on the right

agreement and decency are the same yeah

so if you're in that mindset the bigger

the [ __ ] the better if you're

agreeing with me you're my man I love

what you're saying yes show them right

and the algorithm helps those people

does those people do great on the

algorithm this is a fascinating Dynamic

that happens uh because I have I've

currently hired somebody that looks on

my social media and they block people

because the [ __ ] Will Roll in

they're not actually there to have a

interesting disagreement which I love

they're there to do kind of mockery and

then when they get blocked

they then celebrate that to their Echo

chamber like look at this I got them or

whatever they do or they'll say some

annoying thing like oh so it's so he

talks about he likes you know if I'd

done this they'll say he oh he says he

likes idea Labs but he actually wants to

create an echo chamber but I'm like nope

you're an [ __ ] I'm not I'm not I I

this look at the other 50 people and

this threat that disagreed with me yeah

respectfully they're not blocked yep

exactly you know and so they see it as

some kind of hypocrisy because again

they only see the thing on the right and

they're not understanding that there's

two axes or that I see it as two axes

and so you it's you seem Petty in that

moment but it's like no no you're this

is very specific what I'm doing you're

actually killing the conversation I I in

generally I give all those folks a pass

and just send them love telepathically

but yes like it's getting rid of

[ __ ] in the conversation is the way

you allow for the disagreement you do a

lot of like when I think when like

primitive mindedness comes at you at

least on Twitter I don't know you

feeling internally in that moment but

you do a lot of like

I'm gonna meet that with my higher mind

and just come out and you'll be like and

you'll be like thanks for all the

criticism I love you yeah and that's

that that that's actually a an amazing

response because it just it what it does

is it it that it it unriles up that

person's primitive mind and actually

wakes up their higher mind who says oh

okay you know this guy's not so bad and

suddenly like civility comes back so

it's a very powerful hopefully long term

but the thing is they do seem to drive

away

high quality disagreement because like

because it takes so much effort to uh

disagree in a high quality way I've

noticed this on my blog like my one of

the things I pride myself on is like my

comment section is awesome like there's

there's there's every everyone's being

respectful

no one's afraid to disagree with me

until and say you know tear my post

apart but in a totally respectful way

where the underlying thing is like I'm

here because I like this guy in his

writing

and people disagree with each other and

they get in these long entry and it's

interesting and I read it and I'm

learning and then I you know a couple

posts especially the ones I've got

written about politics it's not like it

seems like any other comment section

people are being nasty to me they're

being nasty to each other and then I

looked down one of them and I realized

like almost all of this is the work of

like three people yeah that's who you

need to block those people need to be

blocked you're not being thin-skinned

you're not being petty doing it you're

actually protecting an idea lab because

what people would really aggressive

people like that do is they'll turn it

into their own Echo chamber because now

everyone is scared to kind of disagree

with them this is unpleasant and so

people who will chime in are the people

who agree with them and suddenly like

they've taken over the space and I kind

of believe that those people on a

different day could actually do high

effort disagreement it's just that

they're in a in a certain kind of mood

and a lot of us just like you said with

the Primitive mind could get into that

mood and it's I believe it's actually

the job of the technology of the

platform to incentivize those folks to

be like are you sure this is the best

you can do like if you really want to

talk [ __ ] about this idea like do better

like yeah and then we need to create

incentives where you get likes for high

effort disagreement because currently

you get likes for like uh something

that's slightly funny and is a little

bit like mockery

like um

yeah basically signals to some kind of

echo chamber that this person is a

horrible person it's a hypocrite as evil

whatever that feels like it's solvable

with technology because I think in our

private lives none of us want that I

wonder if it's making me think that I

want to like because a much easier way

for me to do it just for my

my world would be to say something like

you know here's this axis this high this

is this is part of what I part of what I

like about the latter is is it's a

language that we can use it's like

specifically what we're talking about is

High rung disagreement good low rung

disagreement bad right and so so it

gives us like a language for that and so

what I would say is I would you know my

you know I would have my you know

readers you know understand this axis

and then I would specifically say

something like please

do the the do the do it but why a favor

and upvote regardless of what they're

saying horizontally right regardless of

what their actual view is upvote high

wrongness

they could be tearing me apart they can

be saying great they can be praising me

whatever

uproad High running this and down vote

low rugness and if enough people are

doing that suddenly there's all this

incentive to try to say no I need to

calm my emotion down here and not be

personal because I'm gonna get voted

into Oblivion by these people

I think a lot of people would be very

good at that

they and they not are only would they be

good at that they would want that that

task of saying I know I completely

disagree with this person but this was a

high effort uh High rung

disagreement I guess everyone thinking

about that other access too you're not

just looking at where do you stand

horizontally you're saying well how did

you get there and how are you you know

are you treating ideas like machines are

you treating them like little you know

babies and there should be some kind of

labeling on personal attacks versus idea

disagreement sometimes people like throw

in both a little bit right that's like

all right no there should be a

disincentive at personal attacks versus

idea attacks well you can also what one

metric is

a a respectful disagreement if I see

just say someone else's Twitter and I

see you know you put out a thought and I

see someone say you know as you know

someone say

um you know I don't see it that way

here's here's where I think you went

wrong and they're just explaining

I'm thinking that if Lex reads that he's

gonna be interested he's gonna he's

Gonna Wanna post more stuff right

because he's gonna like that if I see

someone being like

um

uh wow this really shows the kind of

person that you become or shows up I'm

thinking that person is making Lex want

to be on Twitter less it's making him

it's and so what's that doing what that

person is actually doing is they're

putting is they're actually they're

chilling discussion because they're

making it unpleasant to they're making

it scary to say what you think and the

first person isn't at all the first

person is making you want to say more

stuff so and those are both disagree

those are people who both disagree with

you exactly exactly

I want to it's a great disagreements

with friends in Meet space is like

you're they disagree with you they could

be even yelling at you

honestly they could even have some [ __ ]

talk where it's like personal attacks it

still feels good because you know them

well and you know that that [ __ ] talk

because like yeah friends should talk

all the time playing us playing a sport

or a game and again it's it's it's

because they know each other well enough

to know that this is fun we're having

fun and obviously I love you like

exactly you know and and that's that's

important online it's a lot harder yeah

the that obviously I love you that

underlies a lot of human interaction

right seems to be easily Lost online

I've seen some people on Twitter and

elsewhere just behave their worst yeah

and it's like I know that's not who you

are totally like why are you I actually

you know I know who's this human I know

someone personally who is one of the

best people yeah I'm it's just I love

this guy like one of the best like fun

funny like nicest dudes

and he if you would if you looked at his

Twitter only you would think he's a

culture worry or an awful culture

Warrior and you know you know biased and

just stoking anger

and and it comes out of a good place and

I'm not going to give any other info

about it you know specific but like I

think he's describing a lot of people it

comes out of a good place because he

really cares about what he you know it

comes up but it's just I can't Square

the two it's so and that's it you have

to once you know someone like that you

can realize okay apply that to everyone

because a lot of these people are lovely

people and it's just bring even just you

know back in the before social media did

you ever had a friend who like

was just like they had this like

dickishness on text or email that they

didn't have in person you're like wow

like email you is like kind of a dick

and it's like it just certain people

have a different Persona behind the

screen it has for me a person has become

a bit of a meme that uh Lex blocks with

love but there is a degree to that where

this is I don't see people on social

media as representing who they really

are I really do have love for them I

really do think positive thoughts of

them throughout the entirety of the

experience I see this as some weird side

effect of uh online communication and so

it's like to me blocking is not some

kind of a derisive act towards that

individual it's just like saying well a

lot of times what's happened is they

have slipped into a very common delusion

that dehumanizes others so that doesn't

mean they're a bad person we all can do

it but they're dehumanizing you or

whoever they're being nasty to because

they in a way they would never do in

person because in a person they're

reminded that's a person remember I said

the dumb part of my brain when I'm doing

VR like won't step off the cliff but the

smart part of my brain knows I'm just on

the rug that dumb part of our brain

is really dumb in a lot of ways um it's

the part of your brain where you can

set the clock five minutes fast to help

you not be late the smart part of your

brain knows that you did that but the

dumb part will fall for it right that

same dumb part of your brain can forget

that the person behind that screen that

behind that handle is a human that has

feelings and and that doesn't mean

they're a bad person for forgetting that

because it's it's possible well this

really interesting idea and I wonder if

it's true that you're right

is that both primitive mindedness and

high-mindedness tend to be contagious

I hope you're right that it's possible

to make both contagious because there

are sort of um popular intuition is only

one of them the Primitive mindedness is

contagious as as exhibited by social

media they complement you again don't

you think that your your Twitter to me

is like I was just looking down and I

mean it is a

it's just high-mindedness it's just

high-mindedness down down down down down

it's it's gratitude it's optimism it's

love it's forgiveness it's all these

things they're the opposite of grievance

and victimhood and resentment and

pessimism right and

there's I think a reason that a lot of

people follow you because it is

contagious it makes other people feel

those feelings I don't know there's been

I've been recently over the past few

months attacked quite a lot it is

fascinating to watch because there's is

over things that I think I probably have

done stupid things but I'm being

attacked for things that are totally not

worthy of attack I got attacked for a

book list

I saw that by the way I thought I

thought it was great but like you can

always kind of find ways to you know I

guess the assumption is this person

surely is a fraud or some other

explanation he's sure it has dead bodies

in the basement he's hiding or something

like this and then I'm going to

construct The Narrative around that and

ma can attack that I don't know how that

works but there there is um there does

and I think you write this in the book

there seems to be a gravity

pulling people towards the Primitive

mindedness to anything political right

religious certain things sure are bottom

heavy you know yeah for our psyche they

they they they they they they have a

magnet that pulls our psyches downwards

on the ladder and and why why does

politics pull our psyches

down on the ladder because it

for for the tens of thousand years that

we were evolving

um you know during human history it was

life or death

politics was life or death and and and

so

um it was actually an amazing study

where it's like

um they

challenged like 20 different beliefs of

a person and different parts of the

person's brain and they had an MRI going

different parts of the person's brain

lit up when non-political beliefs were

challenged versus political beasts were

challenged when political beliefs were

challenged when non-political beliefs

were challenged

the

like the the rational like the

prefrontal cortex type areas were lit up

when the political beliefs were

challenged and then I'm getting over my

head here but it's like the the parts of

your brain the default mode Network the

parts of your brain associated with like

inter introspection and like your own

identity were lit up and they were much

more likely to change their mind on all

the beliefs the non-political beliefs

when that default mode Network part of

your brain uh lit up you were you were

gonna if anything get more firm in those

beliefs when you when you had them

challenged so

politics is one of those topics that

just it literally literally lights up

different part of our brain it's again I

think we come back to primitive mind

higher mind here it's like it it gets

our higher this is one of the things our

primitive mind comes programmed to care

a ton about and so it's going to be very

hard for us to stay rational and calm

and and looking for truth because we

have all this gravity towards well it's

weird because politics like what is

politics like to talk about it's a bunch

of different issues and each individual

issue if we really talk about tax policy

like why are we being emotional about

this I don't think we're actually that I

mean we're yeah we're emotional about

something else yeah I think what we're

emotional about is

this my side the side I've identified

with is in power and making the

decisions and your side is out of power

and if your side's in power that's

really scary for me because that goes

back to you know the idea of who's

making who's who's pulling the strings

in this tribe right who's and who's the

chief is it your family's patriarch or

is it mine you know like we might not

have food if if we don't win this you

know kind of whatever you know Chief

election so

I I think that it's not about the tax

policy or anything like that and then

and then it gets tied to this like

broader I think a lot of our tribalism

has

really coalesced around this we don't

have that much religious tribalism in

the U.S right now they know the the the

Protestants and the Catholics hate each

other we don't have that really right

and honestly you you say people like to

you know say we have racial tribalism

and everything but

uh White cons you know a white even a

kind of a racist white conservative guy

I think takes the black conservative

over the woke white person any day of

the week right now so that's the

strongest it tells me that Source

television is way stronger tribalism

right now I think that that that that

white racist guys you know loves the

black

conservative guy compared to the white

wolf guy right there's no so so to me

not again not that racial tribalism

isn't a thing of course it's always a

thing but like political tribalism is

the number one right now so race is

almost a topic for the political

division versus the actual sort of

element of the attractive it's a

political football it's yeah so there's

uh I mean this is dark because so this

is a book about human civilization this

is a book about human nature but it's

also a book of politics yeah about

politics

um it is just the way you listed out in

the book

it's kind of dark how we just fall into

these left and right checklists

so if you're on the left it's maintained

where we weighed

universal healthcare good mainstream

media fine guns kill people us is a

racist country protect immigrants tax

costs bad climate change awful raise

minimum wage and on the right is the

flip of that reverse where we weighed

Universal Health Care bad mainstream

media bad people kill people not guns

kill people us was a racist country

protect borders tax Gods good climate

change overblown don't raise minimum

wage I mean it has you almost don't have

to think about any of this well it's

like literally So when you say it's a

book about politics it's interesting

because it it's a book about the

vertical axis right it's specifically

not a book about the horizontal axis and

that I'm not talking I don't actually

talk about any of these issues I I don't

put out an opinion on them

um those are all horizontal right but

when you so and rather than are you know

having you know another book about those

issues about right versus left

I wanted to do a book about this other

axis and so on this axis

the reason I had this checklist is that

this is a low part of the low rung

politics world right low wrong politics

is a checklist and that checklist

evolves right like Russia suddenly is

like popular with the right as opposed

to you know it used to be you know in

the 60s the left was the one defending

Stalin like so they'll switch it doesn't

even matter the substance doesn't matter

it's that this is the approved checklist

of the capital P party and this is what

everyone believes that's a low rung

thing the high rungs this is not what

it's like high rung politics you you

tell me your one view on this I have no

idea what you think about anything else

right and you're gonna say I don't know

about a lot of stuff because inherently

you're not going to have that strong an

opinion because you don't have that much

info these are complex things

so there's a lot of I don't know and

people are all over the place

it's that when it you know you're in you

know you're talking to someone who has

been subsumed with low rung politics

when

if they tell you their opinion on any

one of these issues you could just you

know you could just rattle off their

opinion on every single other one and if

and if in three years it becomes

fashionable to to have this new view

they're gonna have it that's you're not

thinking that's Echo that's Echo chamber

culture and I've been using kind of a

shorthand uh of Centrist to describe

this kind of

a high wrong thinking but people tend to

I mean it seems to be difficult to be a

Centrist or whatever a hiring thinker

it's like people want to label you as a

person because it's too cowardly to take

stance yeah

um somehow as opposed to ask saying I

don't know is the first statement the

problem with Centrist is that would mean

that in each of these tax cuts bag tax

cuts good it means that you are saying I

am in I think we should have some tax

cuts but not that many you might not

think that you might actually come do

some research and say actually I think

tax cuts are really important

that doesn't mean oh I'm not a Centrist

anymore I guess I'm a far you know no no

that's why we need the second axis so

what you're trying to be when you say

Centrist is Hiram which means you might

be all over the place horizontally you

might agree with the far left on this

thing the far right on this thing that

you might agree with the centrists on

this thing but but calling yourself a

Centrist actually like is putting

yourself in a prison on the horizontal

axis and um and it's saying that you

know I I whatever the on the on the

different topics I'm right in between

the two policy wise that's not what you

are so yeah that's what we we're badly

missing this other axis yeah I mean I I

still do think it's this

like for me I am a Centrist when you

project it down to the horizontal but

the point is you're missing so much data

by not considering the vertical because

like on average maybe it falls somewhere

in the middle but in reality there's

just a lot of nuance issue to issue that

involves just thinking and uncertainty

and changing in the given the context of

the current geopolitics and economics

and just always considering always

questioning always evolving your views

all of that not just not just about like

oh I think we should be in the center on

this but another way to be in the center

is if there's some phenomenon happening

um you know there's a terrorist attack

you know and one side wants to say this

has nothing to do with Islam and the

other one the other side wants to say

this is radical Islam

right what's in between those is saying

This is complicated and nuanced and we

have to learn more and it probably has

something to do with Islam and something

to do with

um the economic circumstances and

something to do with you know

geopolitics so in in a case like that

you actually do get really unnuanced

when you go to the extremes and all of

the Nuance which is where all the truth

usually is is going to be in the middle

so yeah but there is a truth to the fact

that if you take that Nuance on those

issues like warn Ukraine covid

you're going to be attacked by both

sides yes people who have who are really

strongly on one side or the other hate

Centrist people I've gotten this myself

and you know the this the the slur that

I've had thrown at me is I'm an

enlightened Centrist in a very mocking

way so what are they actually saying

what does enlightened centers mean it

means someone who is you know Stephen

Pinker or Jonathan height gets accused

of is you know that they're

highfalutin you know intellectual world

and they don't actually have any they

don't actually take a side they don't

actually get their hands dirty and they

can be superior to both sides without

actually taking a stand right so I I see

the argument and I disagree with it

because

I firmly believe that the hardcore

tribes they think they're taking a stand

and they're out in the streets and

they're pushing for something I think

what they're doing is they're just

driving the whole country downwards and

I think they're they're hurting all the

causes they care about and so it's not

that it's not that you know it's not

that we need everyone to be sitting

there you know refusing to take aside

it's that you can be far left and far

right but be upper left and upper right

if we talk about the you use the word

liberal a lot in the book to mean

something that we don't in modern

political discourse mean uh since this

higher philosophical View and then you

use the words Progressive to mean the

left and uh conservative to mean the

right can you describe the concept of

liberal games and power games

so the power games is is what I call the

like basically just the laws of nature

as the

when laws of nature are the laws of the

land that's the power game so animals

watch any David Attenborough special and

when the little lizard is running away

from the the you know the bigger animal

or whatever

um and I use an example of a bunny and a

bear I don't even know if bears eat

bunnies they probably don't but pretend

bears eat bunnies right so it's like in

the power games the bear is chasing the

bunny

there's no fairness there's no okay well

what's right but you know what what what

what what's legal no no if the bear is

fast enough

it can eat the bunny if the bunny is can

get away it can say living in so that's

it that's the Only Rule now humans

have spent a lot of time in essentially

that environment so when you have a

totalitarian dictatorship

it's and so what's the rule of the power

games it's everyone can do whatever they

want if they have the power to do so

it's just a game of power so if the

bunny gets away the bunny actually has

more power than the Bear in that

situation right and likewise the

totalitarian dictatorship there's no

rules that dictator can do whatever they

want they can they can they can torture

they can you know flatten a rebellion

with a lot of murder because they have

the power to do so what are you gonna do

right and that's that's kind of the

state of nature that's our natural way

you know that you know when you look at

the Muff watch a mafia movie

you know there's we do a lot of we have

we have it in us we all have we all can

snap into power games mode when uh it

becomes all about you know just just

actual raw power now the liberal games

is is you know something that's

Civilizations for thousands of years

have been working on it's not invented

by America or modern times but America's

kind of was like the latest crack at it

yet which is this idea instead of

everyone can do what they want if they

have the power to do so it's everyone

can do what they want as long as it

doesn't harm anyone else now that's

really complicated how do you define

harm and and the idea is that everyone

has their a list of rights which are

protected by the government

and then they have they're inalienable

rights and they're they're protected you

know those are protected uh uh Again by

you know um from from an invasion by

other people and so you have this kind

of fragile balance and so the idea with

the liberal games is you that there are

laws but it's not totalitarian they will

build very clear strict laws kind of

around the edges of what you can and

can't do and then everything else

Freedom so unlike a totalitarian

dictatorship actually it's it's very

loose there's a lot of things can happen

and it's kind of up to the people but

there are still laws that protect the

very basic and alienable rights and

stuff like that so it's this much looser

thing now the vulnerability there is

that

it so so the

the benefits of it are obvious right

freedom is great it seems like it's the

most Fair they you know that that

equality of opportunity seemed like the

most fair thing and

um and you know equality before the law

you know due process and all of this

stuff so it seems fair to the founders

of the Us and other Enlightenment

thinkers and it also is a great way to

manifest productivity right you know you

have um you have Adam Smith saying it's

not from the benevolence of the butcher

or the baker that we get our dinner but

from their from their own self-interest

so you have you can harness kind of

selfishness for for progress but

um it has a vulnerability which is that

because the laws it's like the

totalitarian laws they don't have an

excessive loss for no reason they want

to control everything and the US you

know in the US we say they're not going

to do that and so the the second it's

almost two puzzle pieces you have the

laws and then you've got a liberal

culture liberal laws have to be married

to Liberal culture kind of a defense of

liberal Spirit in order to truly have

the liberal games going on and so that's

vulnerable because Free Speech you can

have the First Amendment that's the the

laws part but if if you're in a culture

where anyone who you know speaks out uh

against Orthodoxy is going to be shunned

from the community well you're lacking

the second piece of the puzzle there

you're lacking liberal culture and so

therefore you um you might as well be in

it you might as well not even have the

First Amendment and there's a lot of

examples like that where the culture has

to do its part for the true liberal

games to be enjoyed

so it's just much more complicated much

more nuanced than the power games it's

kind of it's kind of a set of basic laws

that then

are coupled with a basic Spirit to

create this

very awesome in human environment that's

also very vulnerable

so what do you mean the culture has to

play along so for something like a

freedom of speech to work

there has to be a basic what decency

that if all people are perfectly good

then perfect freedom without any

restrictions is great it's where the

human nature starts getting a little

iffy without being cruel to each other

or start being uh greedy and uh Desiring

of harm and also the narcissist and

sociopaths and Psychopaths and Society

all of that that's when you start to

have to inject some limitations on that

freedom yeah I mean if if um

so that what the government basically

says is we're going to let everyone be

mostly free

um but no one no one is going to be free

to

physically harm other people or distill

their property right

um and so we're stuck we're also we're

all agreeing to sacrifice that you know

that that 20 of our freedom and then in

return all of us in theory can be 80

free and that's kind of the the bargain

um but now that's a lot of freedom to

leave people with and

a lot of people choose it's like you're

so free in the U.S you're actually free

to be unfree if you choose that's kind

of what an echo chamber is to me it's

you know

um you can you can choose to kind of be

friends with people who

uh essentially make it make it so

uncomfortable to

speak your mind

that it's no actual effective difference

for you than if you lived in a country

if if you can't you know criticize

Christianity in a certain community

that you have a First Amendment so

you're not going to get arrested by the

government for criticizing Christianity

but if you if but if you have this if

the social penalties are so extreme that

you it's just never worth it you might

as well be in a country that it

imprisons people for criticizing

Christianity and so that same thing goes

for for wokeness right this is what

people get you know cancel culture and

stuff so when the reason these things

are bad is because they're actually

they're depriving

Americans of the beauty of the freedom

of the liberal games by you know

imposing a social culture that is very

power games it's basically a power games

culture comes in and you might as well

be in the power games now and so liberal

if you live in a liberal democracy

it's it's you there will be always be

challenges to a liberal culture

now lowercase L labral um there'll

always be challenges to a liberal

culture from people who are much more

interested in playing the power games

and would and and there has to be kind

of an immune system that stands up to

that culture and says that's not how we

do things here in America actually we

don't excommunicate people for not

having the right religious beliefs or

not you know we don't disinvite a

speaker from campus for having the wrong

political beliefs uh and if it doesn't

stand up for itself it's it's like the

immune system of the country failing and

power games rushes in

so uh before chapter four in your book

uh

uh and the chapters that will surely

result in you being burned at the stake

you write quote we'll start our

Pitchfork tour in this chapter by taking

a brief trip through the history of the

Republican party then in the following

chapters we'll take a Tim's career

tanking Deep dive into America's social

justice movement as you started to talk

about okay so let's go uh what's the

history of the Republican Party

and looking at this through my vertical

ladder I'm saying what is this this

familiar story of the Republicans from

the 60s to today what does it look like

through the vertical lens right does it

look different and and and is there is

there an interesting story here that's

been kind of hidden because we're always

looking at the horizontal now the

horizontal story you'll hear people talk

about it and it's they'll say something

like the Republicans have moved farther

and farther to the right

and um and to me that that's not really

true like it was Trump more right-wing

than Reagan I don't think so I think

he's a lot of actual policy yeah yeah so

it's so we're using this again it's just

like you're calling yourself Centrist

but it's not exactly what you mean even

though it also is yeah

so I again this I was like okay look

this vertical lens helps with other

things let's apply it to the Republicans

and here here's what I saw is

I looked at the 60s

and

I saw an interesting story which I don't

think that you know not everyone's

familiar with like what happened in the

early 60s but in 1960 the Republican

party was very it was a plurality you

had progressives like genuine you know

Rockefeller you know pretty Progressive

people

um all the way to you know then you had

them you know moderates like Eisenhower

and Dewey and then you go all the way to

the you know farther right you had gold

water and you know what you might call I

I call them the fundamentalists um

and so

it's this interesting plurality right

something we don't have today and what

happened was the the Goldwater

contingent which was the Underdog they

were small right the Eisenhower was the

president

uh who had just been the president and

was it seemed like the moderates were

you know it was that's the he said you

have to be close to the center of the

chess board that's where that's that's

how you maintain power these people were

very far from the center of the

chessboard but they ended up basically

have like a hostile takeover they

conquered their own party and they did

it by breaking all of the kind of

Unwritten rules and Norms so they did

things like they first started with like

the college Republicans which was like

this feeder group that turned in you

know a lot of the politicians started

there and they they went to the election

and they wouldn't let the the current

president the incumbent speak and they

were throwing chairs and they were fist

fights and eventually people gave up and

they just sat there and they sat in the

chair talking for you know their got

their candidate until everyone

eventually left and then they declared

Victory so

they basically they they they they they

came in there there was a there was a

certain set of rules agreed upon rules

and they came in playing the power games

saying well actually

if we do this you won't have the power

you know we have the power to to take it

if we just break all the rules right and

so they did and they won and that became

this hugely influential thing which then

they then they conquered California

through again these these people were

taken aback these you know these these

proper Republican candidates were

appalled by the kind of like you know

the insults that are being hurled to

them and the intimidation and the

bullying and eventually they ended up in

the National Convention which was called

like the right wing Woodstock it was

like you know the Republican National

Convention in 64 was just they again it

was jeering and they wouldn't let their

moderates so their their progressives

even speak and there was racism you know

you know Jackie Robinson was there and

he was a proud Republican and he said

that like he feels like he was a Jew in

Hitler's Germany with the way the blacks

were being treated there and it was

nasty and but what did they do they they

had they had fiery you know plurality

enough to win um and they won they ended

up getting crushed in the general

election and they kind of faded away but

to me I was like what that was an

interesting story I see it as

um I have this character in the book

called The Golem which is a big kind of

a big dumb powerful monster that's the

you know the emergent property of like a

political Echo chamber it's like this

big giant it's stupid but it's powerful

and scary

um and to me I was like a Golem rose up

conquered the party for a second knocked

it on its ass and then

and then faded away and to me when I

looked at the Trump Revolution and a lot

and not just Trump the last 20 years I

see that same lower right that lower

right monster kind of

um

making another charge for it but this

time succeeding and really taking over

the party for a long period of time I

see the same story which is the power

games are being played

um in a situation when it had always

been the government relies on all these

Unwritten rules and Norms to function

but for example you have in 2016 Merrick

Garland gets a gets nominated by Obama

and their Unwritten Norm says that when

the president nominates a Justice then

you pass them through unless there's

some egregious thing that's what has

happened but they said actually this is

the last year of his presidency and the

people should choose I don't think we

should set a new precedent where you the

president can't nominate people uh

nominate a Supreme Court Justice in the

last year so they they passed the throw

and it ends up being Gorsuch

um and so they they lose that seat now

three years later it's Trump's last year

and it's another election year

and Ginsburg dies and what did they say

they say oh let's keep our president

they said no oh actually we changed our

mind we're going to nominate Amy Barrett

so to me that is classic power games

right that there there's there's no

actual rule in what you're doing is they

had they did technically have the power

to block the nomination then and then

they technically had the power to put

someone and they and they're pretending

there's some principle to it but they're

just extra they're going for the a

short-term Edge at the expense of what

is like the workings of the system in

the long run and then what do the

Democrats have to do in that situation

because both parties have been doing

this is they either can lose now all the

time or they start playing the power

games too and now you have a prisoner's

dilemma where it's like both are end up

doing this thing because and then

everyone ends up worse off the debt

ceiling All these power plays that are

being made with these these holding the

country hostage this is power games and

to me that's what Goldwater was doing in

the 60s but it was a healthier time in a

way because there was this plurality

within the parties reduced some of the

national tribalism and that there wasn't

as much of an appeal to that but today

it's just like do whatever you have to

do to beat the enemies and so I'm seeing

a rise in power games and I talk about

the Republicans because they did a lot

of these things first they have been a

little bit more Regis but both parties

have been doing it over the last 20 30

years can you place uh blame or maybe

there's a different term for it at uh

the subsystems of this so is it the

media is it the politicians like in the

senate in Congress is it Trump so the

leadership is it

um or maybe it's us

human beings uh maybe social media

versus mainstream media is there a sense

of where what is the cause of what is

the symptom it's very complex so Ezra

client's a great book while we're

polarized where he talks about a lot of

this and there's there's some of these

are you know it's really no one's fault

first of all it's the environment has

changed in a bunch of ways you just

mentioned and what happens when you take

human nature which is a constant and you

put it into an environment

Behavior comes out the environment is

the independent variable when that

changes the dependent variable the

behavior changes with it right and so

the environment has changed in a lot of

ways so one major one is

it used to for a long time actually the

the the the first there was the

Republicans and then the Democrats just

had a Stranglehold on Senate on Congress

there was no it was not even competitive

the Democrats for 40 years had the

majority

and so therefore it actually isn't a

decent environment to compromise it

because now we can both you know what

you want is Congress people thinking

about their home district and and you

know voting yes on a national policy

because we're going to get a good deal

on it back at home that's actually

healthy as opposed to voting and

lockstep together because this is what

the red party is doing regardless of

what's good for my home District you

know an example is Obamacare you know

there are certain Republican districts

that would have actually officially been

benefited by Obamacare but every

Republican voted against it so and part

of the reason is because there's no

longer this obvious majority every few

years it switches it's a 50 50 thing and

that's you know partially because it's

become so we've been so subsumed with

this one National divide of left versus

right that

um that that that that people are not

people are whoever you know they're

voting for the same party for president

uh all the way down the ticket now and

so you have this just kind of 50 50

color war and that's awful for

compromise so there's like 10 of these

things you know that have redistricting

but also it is social media it is you

know I call it hypercharged tribalism

you know in the 60s you had kind of

distributed tribalism you had some

people that are worked up about the USSR

right they're National that's what they

care about U.S versus a foreign some

people that were saying left versus

right like they today and then other

people that were saying that they were

fighting within the party but today you

don't have that it's it's the the you

have ideological realignment so you kind

of got rid of a lot of the in-party

fighting and then there's hasn't been

that big of a foreign threat not nothing

like the USSR for a long time so you

kind of lost that and what's left is

Justice left versus right thing and so

that's kind of this hypercharged

Whirlpool that subsumes everything and

um and so yeah yeah it's I mean you

people point to Newt Gingrich you know

people like there's certain characters

that enacted policies that stoked this

kind of thing but I I think this is a

much bigger kind of environmental shift

well that's going back to our questions

about the role of individuals in human

history so the the interesting one of

the many interesting questions here is

about Trump is he a symptom or a Cause

because it seems to be from the public

narrative such a significant

Catalyst for some of the things we're

seeing this goes back to what we were

talking about earlier right like is it

is it the person or is the times I think

he's a perfect example of it's a both

situation I don't think that I don't

think if you pluck Trump out of the

situation I don't think that Trump was

inevitable but I think we were very

vulnerable to a demagogue and if you

hadn't been Trump would have had no

chance and so what and why were we

vulnerable to a demagogue is because you

have these

Mommy I think it's specifically on the

right

if you actually look at the stats it's

pretty bad like the people who because

because it's not just who voted for

Trump a lot of people just vote for the

red right what's interesting is who

voted for Obama Against Romney and then

voted for Trump who you know these are

not racists right these are not hardcore

Republicans they voted for Obama

and where did the switch come from

places that had economic despair where

Bridges were not working well that's a

signifier you know we're we're paint

chipping in the schools you know these

little things like this so I think that

you know you had this

a lot of these kind of rural towns you

have true Despair and then you also have

a and the number one indicator of voting

for Trump was distrust in media and the

media has become much less trustworthy

you know and so you you have the the all

these ingredients that actually make us

very vulnerable to a demagogue and a

demagogue is someone who takes advantage

right there's someone who comes in and

says I can pull all the right strings

and Pull and and and push all the right

emotional buttons right now and get

myself Power by taking advantage of the

circumstances and that is what Trump

totally did

it makes me wonder how easy it is for

somebody who's a charismatic leader to

uh capitalize on

cultural resentment when when there's

economic hardship to channel that so

John height wrote a great article about

like the true we basically we like truth

is in an all-time low right now like

it's the media is not penalized for

lying yeah right MSNBC Fox News these

are not penalized for being inaccurate

or penalized if they stray from the

Orthodoxy

on social media it's not the truest

tweets that go viral right and so Trump

understood that better than anyone right

he he took advantage of it he he was

living in the current world when

everyone else was stuck in the past and

he saw that and he just lied he

everything he said

you know it doesn't the truth was not

relevant at all right it's just it's

just truly it's not relevant to him and

what he's talking about he doesn't care

and and he knew that neither do is a

subset of the country I was thinking

about this just reading articles by

journalists

especially when you're not a a famous

journalist in yourself but you're more

like in your

times journalist so the big famous thing

is the institution you're a part of to

do like you can just lie yeah because

you're not going to get punished for it

you're going to be rewarded for of the

popularity of an article so if you write

10 articles

it's there's a huge incentive to just

make stuff up you got to get clicks to

get clicks that's the first and foremost

and like culturally

people will attack that article that

says it's not like one half the country

will attack that article saying is

dishonest but they'll kind of forget the

um you will not have a reputational hit

right there won't be a memory like this

person made up a lot of stuff in the

past no they'll take one article at a

time and they'll attach the reputation

hits will be to New York Times the

institution yeah and so for the

individual journalists there's a huge

incentive to make stuff up totally it's

it's it it is and it's scary because

it's almost you can't survive if you're

just an old school honest journalist who

really works hard and tries to get it

right and does it with Nuance like what

you can be is you can be a big time sub

stacker or big time podcaster A lot of

people do have a reputation for accuracy

and rigor and they have huge audiences

but

um if you're working in a big company

right now

um it's I mean especially I mean I like

I I I think that many of the big media

brands are very much controlled by the

left and but I will say that that the

ones that are controlled by the right or

even more egregious not just in terms of

accuracy but also in terms of you know

the New York Times for all of its

criticisms

they have a handful of uh they they

every they here and there they put out a

pretty

you know a an article that Strays from

the they know Barry Weiss wrote there

for a long time and then you've got

um they wrote an article criticizing

free speech on campus stuff you know

recently um and they have you know they

have a couple very you know left uh

Progressive friendly conservatives but

they have conservatives that are

operating the op-eds Fox News you know

you're not seeing thoughtful uh

Breitbart you're not seeing thoughtful

progressives writing there right there's

some degree to which the New York Times

I think still incentivizing the values

the vertical

the high effort so the you're allowed to

have a conservative opinion if you do a

really damn good job yeah like if it's a

very thorough in-depth art kind of and

if you kind of Pander to the progressive

senses in all the right ways you know I

always joke that you know Ted you always

have a couple you know token

conservatives but they get on stage and

they're basically like so totally you're

all you know where the the progressive

systems are that's right about all of

this but maybe maybe you know

libertarianism isn't all about you know

it's just so there is an element but you

know what it's it's something it's

better than than being a total tribal I

think you can you can see the New York

Times tug of war the internal tug of war

you can see it because then they also

have these awful instances you know or

like you know the firing of James

Bennett which is this whole other story

but like they have you yeah you can see

it going both ways but in the 60s what

did you have you had ABC NBC CBS you

know the 70s you know you had these

three news channels and they weren't

always right and they definitely

sometimes narrative together maybe about

the Vietnam or whatever but

they if one of them was just lying

they'd be embarrassed for it they would

be penalized they'd be dinged and they'd

be known as this is the trash one and

that would be terrible for their ratings

because they weren't just catering to

half the country they're kidding they

all located under the whole country so

both on the axis of accuracy and on the

axis of neutrality they had to

you know try to stay somewhere in the

the reasonable range and that's just

gone one of the things I'm really

curious about is I think your book is

incredible

I'm very curious to see how it's written

about by the Press

because I could see click I could myself

write with the help of charge GPT of

course click bait articles in either

direction yeah it's easy to imagine your

whole book is beautifully written for

click bait articles yeah if any

journalists out there need help I can I

can help you yeah okay I can write out

the most atrocious criticisms yeah uh

I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm ready I'm braced

um yeah so speaking of which uh you

write about social justice you write

about two kinds of social justice

liberal social justice and uh sjf social

justice fundamentalism what are those

yeah so like the term wokeness is so

loaded with baggage it's kind of like

mocking and derogatory and that's I was

trying not to do that in this book

um if it's the terms a little bit

baggage you're already kind of you're

you're from from the first minute you're

already behind

um so

to me uh it also that when it when

people say wokeness is bad social

justice is bad they're throwing the baby

out with the bathwater

um because the the pro you know the

proudest tradition in the U.S is liberal

social justice and what I mean by that

again liberal meaning with lowercase L

it is it is intertwined with liberalism

so Martin Luther King Classic example

his I Have a Dream speech he says stuff

like this country you know

is you know has has made a promise

to all of its citizens and it has broken

that promise to to its black citizens

right

in other words liberalism the

Constitution the core ideals those are

great we are not living up to them we're

failing on some of them

so Civil Disobedience the goal of it

wasn't to to hurt liberalism is to

specifically break the laws that were

already violating Liberty that were the

laws that were a violation of liberalism

to expose that this is illiberal that

the constitution should not have people

of different skin color sitting in

different parts of the bus and so it was

it was kind of a it was really patriotic

you know the Civil Rights Movement was

saying this is a beautiful you know we

have a we have a liberalism is this

beautiful thing and we need to do better

at it so I call it liberal social

justice and it used the tools of

liberalism to try to uh

to try to uh improve the flaws and that

we're going on so free speech you know

Mario Savio in the 60s was a you know

he's a leftist and what would the

leftists doing in the 60s on Berkeley

campus you know they were saying we need

more free speech

um because that's what social liberal

social justice was fighting for but you

can also go back to the 20s women's

suffrage I mean so the the you know the

Emancipation the the thing that America

obviously has all of its these These are

these are all ugly things that it had to

get out of but it got out of them you

know one by one and it's still getting

out of them that's what's cool about

America and liberal social justice

basically is the practice of saying

where are we not being perfect liberals

and now let's fix that

so that that's the idea of liberalism

that permeates the history of the United

States but then there's interplay heaven

and so many good images in this book but

one of them is uh is highlighting the

interplay of different ideas over the

past uh let's say 100 years so

liberalism is on one side there's that

thread there's Marxism on the other and

then there's post-modernism

how do those interplay together so it's

interesting because

Marxism

is and all of its various you know

descendants obviously there's a lot of

things that are rooted in Marxism that

aren't you know the same thing as what

Karl Marx preached

but what do they all have in common

they think liberalism is bad right they

actually think that

um

that the opposite of what Martin Luther

King and other people uh in the Civil

Rights and other movements they think

the opposite they think he thinks you

know liberalism is good we need to

preserve it they said liberalism is the

problem these other problems with racism

and inequality that we're seeing those

are inevitable results of liberalism

liberalism is a rigged game and it's

just the power games in Disguise there

is no liberal games it's just the power

games in Disguise and there's the upper

people that oppress the lower people and

they convince the lower people it's all

about false consciousness they convince

the lower people that everything is fair

and now the lower people vote against

their own interests and they and they

work to preserve the system that's

suppressing them and what do we need to

do we need to actually there's much more

revolutionary we need to overthrow

liberalism right so people think is oh

you know like what we call a wokeness is

just you know a normal social justice

activists activism but it's like more

extreme right it's this no no it's the

polar opposite polar opposite and so

um now that's that's the Marxist thread

now post-modernism is kind of you know

this term that is super controversial

and I don't think anyone calls himself a

postmodernist or take all this with a

grain of salt in terms of the term but

what's the definition of radical the

definition of radical to me is

how deep

you want change to happen at so so um a

liberal Progressive

and and a conservative Progressive will

disagree about policies the liberal

Progressive wants to you know change a

lot of policies change change change

change right and the conservative is

more wants to keep things the way they

are

but they're both conservative when it

comes to liberalism

um beneath it the liberal kind of

foundation of the country they both

wanted they both are become

conservatives about that the Marxist is

more radical because they want to go one

notch deeper and actually overthrow that

Foundation now what's below

what's below liberalism is kind of the

core tenets of modernity

um this idea of reason and

um the notion that there is an objective

truth and

um uh science as it's the scientific

method right these things are actually

beneath and even the Marxist if you look

at the Frankfurt School you know these

these these these post-marxist thinkers

and and Marx himself they were not

anti-science they believed in that

bottom bottom

Foundation they were they were they were

they were actually wanted to preserve

modernity but they wanted to get rid of

liberalism on top of it the

post-modernist is even more radical

because they want to actually go down to

the bottom level and overthrow they

think science itself is a tool of

Oppression they think it's a tool uh

where oppression kind of flows through

you know they think that the white

Western world has invented these

Concepts like you know they claim that

there's an objective truth and that

there's you know reason in science and

they think all of that is just one

meta-narrative and right and and it goes

a long way to serve the interests of the

powerful so in the sense that so it's

almost caricatured but that that is to

the core of their beliefs that math

could be racist for example oh yeah

absolutely not the educational math but

literally math the notion in math that

there's a right answer and a wrong

answer that they believe is a

meta-narrative that serves white

supremacy or in in in the post-modernist

might have said it serves just the

powerful

um or the wealthy but to so what social

justice fundamentalism is is you take

the Marxist thread that has been going

on in lots of countries and has and and

who over the upper and lower is that's

what they all have in common but the

upper and lower you know and for Marx

was the ruling class and the oppressed

class it was economic

um and then uh but you come here and and

the economic class doesn't you know

doesn't resonate as much here as it did

maybe in some of those other places but

what does resonate here in the 60s and

70s is race and gender and these kind of

social justice disagreements and so what

social justice fundamentalism is is

basically this this tried and true

framework of

you know this Marxist framework

kind of with a new skin on it which is

American social justice and then made

even more radical with the infusion of

post-modernism where you know not just

as liberalism bad but actually the sign

you know that like you said math can be

racist so it's this kind of like

philosophical Frankenstein this like

stitched together of these it and has

and and so again it's called you you

know they they wear the same uniform as

the liberal social justice they say

social justice right you know Racial

equality

but it has nothing to do with liberal

social justice it is directly opposed to

Liberal social justice this is

fascinating the evolution

of ideas if if we ignore the harm done

by it it's fascinating how humans get

together and evolve these ideas so as

you show Marxism is the idea that

Society is a zero-sum I mean I guess

zero sum is a really important thing

here uh zero-sum struggle between the

ruling class and the working class with

power being exerted through politics and

economics then you add

critical theory Marxism 2.0 on top of

that and you add to politics and

economics you add culture and

institutions and then on top of that for

postmodernism you add science you have

morality basically anything else you can

think to stitch together Frankenstein

and if you notice and which is not

necessarily bad but in this case I think

it's actually violating the Marxist

tradition by being anti-science and and

you know and it's violating the

post-modernism because what

post-modernists were they were Radical

Skeptics not just of they were Radical

Skeptics not just of the way things were

but of their own beliefs they and what

and social justice fundamentalism is

suddenly is not at all uh self self

critical it says that we have the

answers which is the opposite of what

post-modernists would ever say this no

you just have another meta-narrative so

and it's also violating of course the

tradition of like liberal social justice

in a million ways because it's it's

anti-liberal

um and so this Frankenstein comes

together meanwhile liberal social

justice doesn't have a Frankenstein it's

very clear it's very it's a crisp

ideology that says we need we there are

trying to make we're trying to get to a

more perfect union they're trying to to

to keep the promises made in the

Constitution and that's what it's trying

to do and so it's it's much simpler in a

lot of ways so you write that my big

problem with social justice

fundamentalism isn't the ideology itself

it's what it's Scholars and activists

started to do sometimes around 2013 when

they began to wield a Kajol that's not

supposed to have any place in the

country like the US so it's the actions

not the ideas

I don't like the ideology I think it's a

low-rung ideology I think it's morally

inconsistent based on you know it

flip-flops on on its morals depending on

the the group I think it's Echo chambery

I think it's um I I think it's it's it's

full of inaccuracies and kind of can't

stand up to debate so I think it's a lot

but but there's a ton of lowering

ideologies I don't like I don't like a

lot of religious doctrines I don't like

a lot of political doctrines right

the U.S is a place inherently that is a

mishmash of a ton of ideologies and I'm

not going to like two-thirds of them at

any given time so my problem the reason

I'm writing about this is not because

I'm like by the way this ideology is not

something I like that's not interesting

the reason that it must be written about

right now this particular ideology is

because

it's not playing nicely with others what

what I if you want to be a hardcore you

know Evangelical Christian go in the US

says Live and Let Live not only are you

allowed to to have an echo chamber of

some kind you're it's actively protected

here Live and Let Live they can do what

they want you do what you want now if

the Evangelical Christians started

saying by the way anyone who says

anything that conflicts with Evangelical

Christianity is going to be severely

socially punished and they have the

cultural power to do so which they don't

in this case they might like you but

they don't have the power but I'd be

able to get anyone fired who they want

and they're able to actually change the

curriculum in all these schools in class

to to suddenly not conflict with no more

evolution in the in the textbooks

because they don't want it now I would

write a book about why about Evangelical

Christianity because that's what every

liberal regardless of what you think of

the actual horizontal beliefs

doesn't matter what they believe when it

when they start violating Live and Let

Live

and shutting down other area other

segments of society and in kind of it's

almost like a you know not to you know

it's not the best analogy but like it's

like a a Neco chamber is like a benign

tumor and what you what you have to

watch out for is a tumor that starts to

metastasis that starts to forcefully

spread and damage the tissue around it

and that's what this particular ideology

has been doing do you worry about it you

know as an existential threat

to to liberalism in in the west in the

United States

is it a problem or is it

the biggest problem that's threatening

all of human civilization it's I I would

never I would not say it's the biggest

problem it it might be I wouldn't if

someone if it turns out in 50 years

someone says actually it was I wouldn't

be shocked

but I also I would I wouldn't bet on

that because there's a lot of problems

I'm a little Sergeant drop it it is

popular to say that kind of thing though

and it's less popular to say the same

thing about AI or nuclear weapons which

worries me that I'm more worried about

nuclear weapons even still than I am

about wokeism so I've gotten I've had

probably a thousand arguments about this

that's one nice thing about spending six

years procrastinating on getting a book

done is you end up test battle testing

your ideas a million times so I've heard

this one a lot right which is

there's kind of three groups of former

Obama voters one is super woke now yeah

another one is super anti-woke now and

the third is what you just said which is

sure Wellness is over the top right

they're not you're not woke but

I think that the anti-woke people are

totally lost their mind and it's just

not that big a deal right

now here's why I disagree with that

because it's not it's not wokeness

itself

it's that

a of radical

um political movement of which there

will always be a lot in the country

has managed to do something that a

radical movement is not supposed to be

able to do in the U.S which is they've

managed to

hijack

institutions all across the country and

hijack

medical journals and universities and

you know the ACLU you know saying all

the you know activist organizations and

non-profits and and certain ngos yeah

and many and many tech companies and

what so it's not that I think this thing

is so bad it's a little like we said

with Trump it's that what I'm what's the

reason Trump scares me is not because

Trump's so bad it's that because it

shows it's it reveals that we were

vulnerable to a demagogue candidate and

what wokeness reveals to me is that we

are currently and until something

changes will continue to be vulnerable

to a

um

a bully a bully movement and a

forcefully expansionist movement that

wants to actually

um

destroy the workings you know their

liberal gears and tear them apart and so

so here's the way I view a liberal

democracy is it is a it is is a bunch of

these institutions that were that were

trial and error crafted over you know

hundreds of years

and they all rely on trust public trust

and there's certain kind of feeling of

unity that actually is critical to a

liberal democracy's functioning and with

I see this thing is as a parasite on

that that whose goal is and I'm not

saying by the way each individual in

this is I don't think they're bad people

I think that it's it's the ideology

itself has the property of its goal is

to tear apart the pretty delicate

workings of the liberal democracy and

Shred the critical lines of trust

and so you talk about Ai and you talk

about all these other big problems

nuclear right the reason I I like

writing about that stuff a lot more than

I like writing about politics this was a

fun topic for me is because I realized

that like all of those things if they're

gonna have a good future with those

things and they're actually threats like

I said we need to have a wits about us

and we need the the liberal you know

gears and and levers working we need the

liberal machine working and so if

something's threatening to undermine

that it affects everything else

we need to have our scientific mind

about us about these foundational ideas

but I I guess my sense of hope comes

from observing the immune system respond

to wokism

there seems to be a pro-liberalism

immune system

and not only that so like there's

intellectuals there's people that are

willing to do the fight you talk about

courage are being courageous and there

is a hunger for that such that those

ideas can become viral and they take

over so I just don't see a mechanism by

which wokism

accelerates like exponentially and takes

over like is expand it feels like as it

expands the immune system responds uh of

the the the immune system of the of

liberalism of of basically a country in

at least the United States that's still

ultimately at the core of the individual

values the freedom of speech Just

freedoms in general the freedom of an

individual but that's the battle

so to me it is like a virus and an

immune system yeah and

I totally agree I see the same story

happening and I you know I'm sitting

here rooting for the immune system but

you're still worried well here's the

thing so a liberal democracy is in

always going to be vulnerable to a

movement like this right and there will

be more because it's not a totalitarian

dictatorship because if you can socially

pressure people to not say what they're

thinking you can suddenly start to just

take over right you can break the

liberalism of the liberal democracy

quite easily and suddenly a lot of

things are illiberal

on the other hand

the same vulnerability the same system

that's vulnerable to that also is hard

to truly conquer

because now the maoists

right similar kind of vibe they were

saying that science is evil and as a you

know and that they're the intellectuals

are you know it's all it's all this big

conspiracy

but they could murder you

and they had the hard cudgel in their

hand right and the hard cudgel

is scary and

um and and you can conquer a country

with the hard cudgel but you can't use

that in the U.S so what they have is a

soft cudgel which can have the same

effect

initially you can scare people into

shutting up you can't maybe imprison

them and murder them but if you can

socially ostracize them and get them

fired that basically is going to have

the same effect so the soft cudgel can

have the same effect for a while but the

thing is

it's it's a little bit of a house of

cards because it relies on fear and as

soon as

that fear goes away

the whole thing falls apart right the

soft cultural requires people to be so

scared of getting canceled or getting

whatever and as soon as some people

start you know Toby Luca of Shopify I

always like think about you know he just

said you know what I'm not scared of

this soft cudgel and spoke up

and said we're not political at this

company and we're not a family we're a

team and we're going to do this and you

know what like they're thriving you will

be on this podcast his seems like a

fascinating he's amazing he spoke up

he's one of the smartest and like

kindest dudes but he's also

um he has courage at a time when it's

hard but here's the thing is that it's

different than that you need so much

less courage against a soft cudgel than

you do the Iranians throwing their

hijabs Into the Fire those people's

courage just just blows away any courage

we have here because they might get

executed

that's the thing is that you can

actually have courage right now and it's

so

don't worry about it

um

oh man the irony of that and you talk

about so two things to fight this

there's two things awareness and courage

what's the awareness piece

the awareness piece is

um

is is under first just no understanding

the stakes

like getting our heads out of the sand

and being like technology is blowing up

exponentially where our society's trust

is devolving like we're kind of falling

apart in some important ways we're

losing our grip on some stability at the

worst time

that's the first point just a big

picture and then also awareness of I

think this vertical axis or whatever

your version of it is this concept of

how do I really form my beliefs where do

they actually come from where you know

did they are they someone else's beliefs

am I following a checklist

um how about my values you know I used

to identify with the blue party or the

red party but now they've changed and

and I suddenly am okay with that is that

because my values change with it or am I

actually anchored to the party not to

any principle asking yourself these

questions

um asking you know looking for where do

I feel disgusted by fellow human beings

you know that maybe I'm I'm being a

crazy tribal person without realizing it

how about the people around me am I

being bullied by some Echo chamber

without realizing it

um am I the bully somewhere right so

that's the first just just I think just

to kind of do a self-audit and and and

um and I think that like just just some

awareness like that it's just a

self-audit about these things can can go

a long way but if you don't if you keep

it to yourself it's almost useless

because if it doesn't if you don't have

without you know awareness without

courage does very little so courage is

when you take that awareness and you

actually export it out into the world

and it starts affecting other people and

so courage can happen on multiple levels

it can happen by first of all just stop

saying stuff you don't believe if you're

being pressured by a kind of a ideology

or a movement to say stuff that you

don't actually believe just stop just

just just stay in your ground and don't

say anything that's that's courage

that's one first step

start speaking out in small groups

starts you know actually speaking around

see what happens the sky doesn't usually

fall actually people usually respect you

for it like you know and it's not not

every group but like you'd be surprised

and then eventually you know maybe start

speaking out in bigger groups start

going public you know Global go public

with it but and you don't need everyone

doing this look some people will lose

their jobs for it I'm not talking to

those people most people won't lose

their jobs but they have the same fear

as if they would right and it's like

what are you gonna get criticized or are

you gonna get a bunch of people you know

angry Twitter people will will criticize

you like it yeah it's not pleasant but

actually that's a little bit like our

primitive Minds fear that really

back when it was programmed that kind of

ostracism or criticism will get leave

you out of the tribe and you'll die

today it's kind of a delusional fear

it's not actually that scary and the

people who have realized that can can

exercise incredible leadership right now

so you have a really interesting

description of censorship of

self-censorship also as you've been

talking about uh who's King mustache and

uh this Gap I think I hope you write

even more even more than you've written

in the book about these ideas because

it's so strong this this censorship gaps

that are created between the dormant

thought pile

and uh the kind of thing under the

speech curve yeah so first of all so I

like to think of

I think it's a useful tool is this thing

called a thought pile which is if you

have a On Any Given issue you have a

horizontal spectrum and just say I could

take your brain out of your head and I

put it on the thought pile right where

you happen to believe about that issue

now I did that for everyone in the in

the community or in a society and you're

going to end up with a big mushy pile

that I think will often form a bell

curve if it's really politicized it

might form like a camel with two humps

because it's like concentrated here but

for a typical issue it'll just form you

know a fear of AI you're going to have a

bell curve right you know things like

this that's the thought pile now the

second thing is a line that's I call the

speech curve which is what people are

saying so this feature curve is high

when not just a lot of people are saying

it but it's being said from the biggest

platforms being said in the you know on

the you know in the New York Times and

it's being said by the president on you

know in the State of the Union those

things are the top of the speech curve

now and and then as you know and then

when the speech occurs lower it means

it's being said either whispered in

small groups or it's just not very many

people are talking about it now a

healthy when a when a free speech

democracy is healthy on a certain topic

you've got the speech curve sitting

right on top of the thought pile they

they mirror each other which is

naturally what would happen more people

think something is going to be said more

often and from higher platforms

what censorship does and that censorship

can be from the government I so I use

the tale of King mustache and King

mustache she's a little tiny Tyrant and

he's very sensitive and people are

making fun of his mustache and they're

saying he's not a good King and he does

not like that so what does he do he

enacts a policy and he says anyone who

has heard criticize anyone who's heard

criticizing me or my mustache or my rule

will be put to death

and immediately at the town was because

his father was a very liberal it was

always free speech in in his kingdom but

now King mustache has taken over and

he's saying this is a new new rules now

and so a few people yell out and they

say that's not how we do things here

and that moment it's what I call a

moment of truth

did the king's guards stand with the

principles of the kingdom and say yeah

King mustache that's not what we do in

which case he would kind of have to he's

nothing he can do

or are they going to execute so in this

case it's as if he laid down an electric

fence over a part of this thought pile

and said no one's allowed to speak over

here the speech curve maybe people will

think these things but the speech curve

cannot go over here

but the electric fence wasn't actually

electrified until the king's guards in a

moment of truth get scared and say okay

and they hang the five people who spoke

out so in that moment that fence just

became electric and now no one

criticizes King mustache anymore so I

use this as an allegory now of course he

has a hard cudgel because he can execute

people but now when we look at the U.S

what you're seeing right now is a lot of

pressure

which is very similar an electric fence

is being laid down saying no one can

criticize these ideas

and if you do you won't be executed

you'll be canceled you'll be you'll be

you'll be fired now what is that fence

electrified from there no they can't

actually they're not working the company

they can't fire you

but they can start a Twitter mob when

someone violates that speech curve when

someone violates that speech Rule and

then the leadership at the company has

the moment of truth

and what the leaders should do is stand

up for their company's values which is

almost always in favor of the employee

and say look you know even if they made

a mistake they make people make mistakes

we're not going to fire them or maybe

that person actually said something

that's reasonable we should discuss it

but either way we're not going to fire

them and if they said no what happens is

the Twitter mom actually doesn't have

they can't execute you they they go away

and the fence has proven to have no

electricity what's been the problem with

the past few years is what's happened

again and again is the leader gets

scared and they don't they get scared of

the front when they fire them boom that

fence has electricity and now actually

if you cross that

it's not just you know a threat like you

will have you'll be out of a job like

it's really bad like you'll have a huge

penalty you might not be able to feed

your kids

so that's an electric fence that goes up

now what happens when an electric fence

goes up and it's proven to actually be

electrified the speech curve morphs into

a totally different position and now

these new people say instead of having

the kind of marketplace of ideas you

know that turns into a kind of a natural

belt curve they say no no these ideas

are okay to say not just okay you'll be

socially rewarded and these ones don't

that's the rules of their own Echo

chamber that they're now applying to

everyone and it's working and so the

speech curve distorts and so you end up

with now instead of one region which is

a region of kind of active communal

thinking what people are thinking and

saying you now have three regions

you have a little active communal

thinking but mostly you now have this

dormant thought pile which is all these

these opinions that suddenly everyone's

scared to say out loud everyone's

thinking but they're scared to say

everyone's thinking but no one's saying

and then you have this other region

which is this the the approved ideas of

this now cultural kind of dictator

and those are being spoken from the

largest platforms and they're being

repeated by the president and they're

being repeated all over the place you

know even though people don't believe it

and that's this Distortion and what

happens is the the society becomes

really stupid because active communal

thinking is the region where we can

actually think together and now no one

can think together and it gets it gets

siled into small private conversations

it's really powerful what you said about

institutions and so on it's not trivial

to from a leadership position to be like

no we we defend the employee or defend

the

um yeah the the employee the person with

us on our like because we don't there's

because there's no actual

uh ground to the any kind of violation

we're hearing about so the mob they

resist the mob it's ultimately to the

leader I guess of a particular

institution of a particular company and

it's difficult oh yeah no no it's not I

don't if it were easy it wouldn't it it

there wouldn't be all of these failings

and by the way this is that's the immune

system failing that's the liberal immune

system of that company failing but also

then it's an example which means a lot

of other you know it's failing kind of

to the country it's not easy of course

it's not because what because we have

primitive Minds that are wired to care

so much about what people think of us

and even if we're not gonna you know

maybe first of all we're scared that

it's going to start a because you know

what you know what what do mobs do

they don't just say I'm going to

criticize you I'm going to criticize

anyone who still buys your product I'm

going to criticize anyone who goes on

your podcast so it's not just you it's

now suddenly if if if if Lex becomes

tarnished enough now I go on the podcast

and people are saying oh I'm not buying

his book he went on Lex Friedman no no

thanks right and now I get by there it's

a call I call it a smear web like you've

been smeared and it's so we're in such a

you know bad time that it smear travels

to me and now meanwhile someone buys my

book and tries to share it someone said

you're buying that guy's book you know

he goes on Lex Freeman you see how this

happens right so that hasn't happened in

this case but that so we are so wired

hey that is kind of bad right like that

is actually like bad for you but but

we're wired to care about it so much

because it meant life or death back in

the dead yeah yeah yeah and luckily in

this case we're both uh you probably can

smear each other in this conference this

is wonderful I I smear you all given

given the nature of your book

um

what do you think about freedom of

speech as a term and as an idea as a way

to resist the mechanism this mechanism

of uh dormant thought pile and

artificially generated speech

this ideal of the freedom of speech and

protecting speech and celebrating speech

well so this is this is kind of

the point I was talking about earlier

about

King mustache

made a rule against for he's created

official because just I just love the

the one of the amazing things about your

book as you get later and later in the

book you cover more and more difficult

issues as a way to illustrate the

importance of the vertical perspective

but there's something about using

hilarious drawings throughout that make

it much more fun and it takes you away

from the personal somehow and you start

thinking in the space of ideas versus

like outside of the tribal type of

thinking so it's a really brilliant I

mean I would advise for anybody to do

con when they write controversial books

to have hilarious drawings it's true

like put the silly stick figure in your

thing and it lightens it does it

lightens the mood it gets people's guard

down a little bit you know and it works

it it reminds people that like we're all

friends here right like we're you know

that's like you know laugh at ourselves

laugh at the laugh at the fact that

we're like in a culture War a little bit

and now we can talk about it right as

opposed to like getting like religious

about it but but basically like King

mustache had no First Amendment he said

we the government is censoring right

which is very common around the world

right Government Center all them the US

you know again there's some you can

argue there's some controversial things

recently but basically the US the First

Amendment isn't the problem

right no one is being arrested for

saying the wrong thing but this graph is

still happening and so so freedom of

speech when people if what people like

to say is if someone's can't complaining

about like cancel culture and saying you

know this is this is you know an

anti-free speech

people like to point out no it's not the

government's not arresting you for

anything this is called like you know

the free market buddy like this is

called

you know you're putting your ideas out

and you're getting criticized and your

precious Marketplace of ideas there it

is right I've gotten this a lot

and this is not making a critical

distinction between cancel culture and

criticism culture

um

criticism culture is a little bit of

this kind of high wrong idea lab stuff

we talked about criticism culture

attacks the idea and and and and and and

and

encourages further

discussion right it enlivens discussion

it makes everyone smarter

cancel culture attacks the person very

different can criticism culture says

here's why this idea is so bad let me

tell you cancer culture says here's why

this person is bad and no one should

talk to them and they should be fired

and what does that do it doesn't enliven

the discussion it makes everyone scared

to talk and it's the opposite it shuts

down discussion so you still have your

first amendment but first amendment plus

cancel culture equals you might as well

be in king must you might as well have

government censorship right first

amendment plus criticism culture great

now you have this vibrant Marketplace of

ideas so

there's a very clear difference

um and so when when people criticize the

cancel culture and then someone says oh

see you're so sensitive now you look

you're doing the cancel culture yourself

you're trying to punish this person for

critics like no no no no

every good liberal and I and I mean that

in the lower case which is that anyone

who believes in Liberal democracies

regardless of what they believe should

stand up and say no to cancel culture

and say this is not okay regardless of

what the actual topic is and that makes

them a good liberal versus if they're

trying to cancel someone who's just

criticizing they're doing the opposite

now they're shutting so it's the

opposite things but it's very easy to

get confused you can see

people take advantage of the and

sometimes they just don't know it

themselves the the lines here can be

very confusing the wording can be very

confusing and be without that wording

suddenly it looks like someone who's

criticizing cancel culture is

canceling but they're not

you uh applied this thinking to

universities in particular

there's a great

yet another great image on the trade-off

between knowledge and conviction and

it's what's commonly actually can maybe

explain to me the difference but you uh

it's often referred to the

dunning-kruger effect where you uh when

you first learn everything you have an

extremely

um high confidence about

self-estimation of how well you

understand that thing you actually say

that dining cougar means something else

so yeah it's everyone I post this

everyone's like Dunning Krueger and it's

a and it's what everyone thinks Dunning

Kruger isn't Dunning Kruger is a little

different it's it's you have a diagonal

line like this one right which is the

place you are it's the I I call it like

the humility tightrope it's a humility

Sweet Spot it's exactly the right level

of humility based on what you know if

you're below it you're insecure you

actually have too much humility you

don't have enough confidence because you

know more than you're giving yourself

credit for and when you're above the

line you're in the Arrogant zone right

you're you need to you need a dose of

humility right you think you know more

than you do so y'all want to stay on

that tightrope and Dunning Kruger is

basically a straight line that's just uh

has a lower slope so you start off you

still are you still are getting more

confident as you go along

but you

start off above that line and as you

learn more you end up below the line

good later so but anyway so this wavy

thing this wavy thing is is a different

phenomenon and it's just related but so

this idea so for people just listening

um there's a child's Hill pretty damn

sure you know a whole lot and feeling

great about it that's in the beginning

and then there's an insecure Canyon you

crash down acknowledging that you don't

know that much and then there's a growth

Mountain growing up Mount grown-up

Mountain uh where after you feel ashamed

and embarrassed about not knowing that

much you begin to realize that knowing

how little you know is the first step in

becoming someone who actually knows

stuff and that's the uh the grown-up mom

and you climb and climb and climb uh

you're saying that in universities we're

pinning people

at the top of the child's Hill so so for

me this is a very you know I think of

myself with this because I went to

college like a lot of 18 year olds and I

was very cocky I just thought I knew it

I know and um when it came to politics I

was like bright blue just because I grew

up in a bright blue suburb and I wasn't

thinking that hard about it and I

thought that you know

um and what I did when I went to college

is met a lot of smart conservatives and

a lot of smart progressives

um but I've met a lot of people who

weren't just going down a checklist and

they knew stuff

and when I and suddenly I realized that

like a lot of these views I have are not

based on knowledge

they're based on other people's

conviction everyone else thinks that's

true now I think it's well you know I'm

I'm actually like

I'm I'm transferring someone else's

conviction to me and who knows why they

have conviction they might have

conviction because they're transferring

from someone else and I'm a smart dude I

thought why why am I

why am I like giving away my own

independent you know learning

yeah abilities here and just adopting

other views so anyway it was this

humbling experience it wasn't just about

politics by the way it was that I had

strong views about a lot of stuff and I

just I got lucky not or not lucky I

sought out

you know the kind of people I sought out

were the type that loved to disagree and

they were man they knew stuff

and so you're quickly in you know in in

again ideal lab culture it was an idea

lab and also I also went to I started

getting in the habit I Started Loving

listening to people who disagreed to me

because it was so exhilarating listening

to a Smart part when I thought there was

no no Credence to this other argument

right the the the the this side of this

debate is obviously wrong I wanted to

see an Intelligence Squared on that

debate in particularly I wanted to go

see I actually got into Intelligence

Squared in college I wanted to see a

smart person who disagrees with me talk

it became so fascinating to me right it

was the most interesting thing that was

a new thing I didn't think I liked that

and so what did that do that that shoved

me down the humble tumble here and

number three it shoved me down where I

started to and then I and then I went

the other way where I realized that I

had been a lot of my identity had been

based on this faux feeling of knowledge

this idea that I thought I knew

everything now that I don't have that I

was like I felt really like dumb and I

felt really almost like embarrassed of

what I knew and so that's where I call

this insecure Canyon I think it's

sometimes when you're so used to

thinking you know everything and then

you realize you don't it's like it's and

then you start to realize that actually

really awesome thinkers they were if

they they don't judge me for this they

totally respect if I say I don't know

anything about this and say oh cool you

should read this and this and this they

don't say you don't know anything they

don't say that right and so

and not that I'm by the way this is not

to say I'm now on grown-up mountain and

you should all join me I often find

myself drifting up with like a helium

balloon oh I think I read about the new

thing and suddenly I think I have I

think I I you know I read three things

about you know a new AI thing and I'm

like I'll go do a talk on this I'm like

no I won't I don't I I just I'm gonna

just be spouting out the opinion of the

person I just read so I have to remind

myself but it's useful now what the

reason my problem with colleges today

is that it's I was a graduated in 2004.

this is a recent change is that

all of those speakers I went who

disagreed with me a lot of them were

conservative

so many of those speakers would not be

allowed on campuses today and so many of

the discussions I had room big groups or

classrooms and this is still you know

this was a liberal campus

so many of those disagreements

um uh they're not happening today and

you I've interviewed a ton of college

students it's chilly it is you know

people keep to themselves so what's

happening is not only are people losing

that push-off child's Hill which was so

valuable to me so valuable to me as a

thinker it kind of started my life as a

better thinker they're losing that but

actually what college a lot of the

college classes and the vibe in colleges

a lot of what is now saying that there

is one right set of views and it's this

kind of you know woke ideology

um and it's right and anyone who

disagrees with it is bad and anyone and

and don't speak up you know unless

you're gonna agree with it it's teaching

people that child's Hills that you know

it's nailing people's feet to child's

Hill it's teaching people that these are

right this user right and like you don't

have any you nothing to you should feel

a complete conviction about them yeah

how do we fix it

is is it part of the administration is

it part of the culture as a part of the

uh is is a part like actually instilling

in the individual like 18 year olds the

idea that this is

the beautiful way to live is to embrace

the disagreement and the growth from

that it's awareness and courage it's the

same thing so first of all just get when

awareness is people need to see

what's happening here that kids are

getting losing the they're not going to

college and becoming better tougher more

robust thinkers yeah

they're actually going to college and

becoming zealots they're getting taught

to be zealots and they at in the website

still advertises you know wide variety

of I've you know the website is a bait

and switch you listen to all the

universities yeah it's a bait and switch

it's it's still saying here you're

coming here for a wide intellectual

basically they're advertising this is an

idea lab and you get there and it's like

actually it's an echo chamber that

you're paying money for so if people

realize that they start to get mad

hopefully

and then courage I mean starts you know

yes Brave students there's been some

very brave students who have started you

know big think clubs and stuff like that

where it's like we're gonna have you

know present both sides of a debate here

and that that takes courage but also

um courage and Leadership

um like the the it's it's like if you

look at these colleges it's specifically

the leaders

who show strength

who get the best results

remember the cultural is soft so if a

leader of one of these places says you

know the the college presidents who have

shown some strength

um they actually don't get as much

trouble it's the ones who Pander the

ones who

um

uh in that you know in that moment of

truth they they they shrink away then

they get a lot more trouble the mob

smells blood

for The Listener uh the the podcast

favorite Liv bury just entered and your

friend just entered the room uh do you

mind if she joins us please I think

there's a story she has about you

so live

you mentioned something that there's a

funny story about we haven't talked at

all about the actual process of writing

the book is is there you guys made a bet

of some kind

yeah

is this a true story is this a

completely false fact it's true Liv is

she's mean when she I didn't I did not

know mean live she's like she's like a

bully she's like scary I have to have

that have that screenshot so Liv was

FaceTiming me and she was like

she was like being intimidating I took a

screenshot and I made it my phone

background so every time I opened it I

was like so to give the background of

this it's because if you hadn't noticed

Tim started writing this book how many

years ago six 2016. mid 2016. right as

sort of a response to like the Trump

stuff not even yeah it was just supposed

to be a mini post I was like oh I'm so

like I was like I'm looking at all these

like future Tech things and I feel this

like uneasiness like ah we're gonna like

mess up all these things why there's

like some Cloud over our society let me

just write a mini post and I open it up

to Wordpress to write a one day little

essay

and things went on politics it was going

to be on like this feeling I had that

that like this feeling I had that

um we were our Tech was was just growing

and growing and we were becoming less

wise what's up what's up with that and I

just wanted to write like just like a

little like little thousand word essay

on like something I think we should pay

attention to and that was the beginning

of this six-year nightmare

did you anticipate those the blog post

would take a long while

um

I don't remember the process fully in

terms of I remember you saying I'm

actually writing this is it's turning

into a bigger thing and I was like um

you know because the more we talked

about remember we were talking about it

I was like oh this goes deep because I

didn't really understand the full scope

of the situation like nowhere near and

you sort of explained it I was like okay

yeah I see that and then the more we dug

into it the sort of the deeper and

deeper and deeper it went but no I did

not anticipate it would be six years

let's put it that way and when was your

Ted Talk on uh procrastination so that

was that was March of 2016 and I started

this book three months later it fell

into the biggest procrastination Hall

that I've ever fallen into oh wow the

irony isn't lost on me I mean it's like

it's I I just like I like how much cred

I have as for that Ted talk I'm like I

am legit procrastinator that is not I'm

not just saying it like it wasn't just

that sure because I mean it did you know

you did intend it to start out as a blog

post but then you're like actually this

needs to maybe multiple and she does

make it into a full series you know what

I'll turn it into a book and then as

well and and what what also what Liv

witnessed a few times and my wife has

witnessed like 30 of these is like these

these 180 epiphanies or I'll be like

I'll like I'll have a moment when I'm

and I don't know what you know sometimes

it's that there's a really good idea but

sometimes it's like I'm just dreading

having to finish this the way it is and

so this epiphanies where it's like you

know what I need to start over from the

beginning and just make this like a

short like 20 little blog post list and

then I'll do that and I was like no no I

have like a new Epiphany I have to and

it's these and and yeah it's kind of

like the crazy person a little bit but

anyway can I tell the story of the the

the bed go for it all right so things

came to my head when we were in we were

on vacation in the Dominican Republic uh

Tim and his wife me an eagle

and we were in the ocean and I remember

you'd been in the ocean for like an hour

just bobbing in there becoming it and we

got talking and we were talking about

the book and

you know you were expressing just like

this

you know the just the horror of the

situation basically you're like look I

just I'm so close but there's still this

and then there's this and

um an idea popped into my head which is

the you know poker players often uh we

we will set ourselves like negative bets

you know like uh essentially if we don't

get a job done then we have to do

something we really don't want to do so

instead of having a carrot like a really

really big stick

um so I had the idea to ask Tim okay

what is the worst either organization or

individual uh or that you if you had to

you know that you would loathe give a

large sum of money to and he thought

about it for a little while and he gave

his answer

and I was like all right

what's your net worth he said his net

worth all right 10 of your net worth to

that thing if you don't get the draft

because oh that's sorry but just before

that I'd asked him how long like if you

had a gun to your head onto your wife's

head

and you had to get the book into a state

where you could like send off an edit to

the art to a draft to your editor how

long he's like oh I guess like I could

get it like 95 good in a month I was

like okay great in one month's time if

you do not have that edit yeah

really scary ten percent of your net

worth is going to this thing that you

really really think is terrible but

you're forgetting the kicker go on

the kicker was that because you know

procrastinators they self-defeat that's

what they do and then Liv says I'm going

to sweeten the deal

and I am going to basically match you

and I'm going to put in I'm going to

send this like a huge amount of my own

money there if you don't do it so and

and I can't that's that would be really

bad so not only are you screwing

yourself just screwing a friend and she

and she was like and and as your friend

because I'm your friend I will send it I

will send the money

I mean like that you know like tyranny

yeah um and um

I got the draft in yeah

I know well I was Igor could have tested

this like actually it was it was funny

because it was it was like supposed to

be by the summer solstice or whatever it

was it was like a certain date

and it was like before I got it in at

four and I got no I got it in at four

a.m like the next morning but then and

and and and and they were both like that

doesn't count I'm like it does it's

still for me it's the same day still

it's okay can you imagine how [ __ ] in

the head you have to be yeah so like

literally technically pass the deadline

by four hours

an obscene amount of money to a thing

you loathe that's how bad his his

sickness because I knew the hard hard

deadline I knew that there was no way

she was gonna actually send that money

because it was 4am so I knew I actually

had the whole night so yeah you know I

should actually punish you and Justice I

should send like a nominal amount to

that thing no thanks no but uh is there

some micro like lessons from that from

how to avoid procrastination writing a

book that you've learned yes well I've

learned a lot of things I mean like

first don't take don't write like a

dissertation about like proving some

Grand theory of society because that's

really procrastinating like I I would

have been an awful PhD student for that

reason some and so like I'm gonna do

another book and it's going to be like a

bunch of short chapters that are

one-offs because that's like it just

doesn't feed into because your book is

like a giant like framework there's

Grand theories I know all through your

book I know and I learned not to do that

again I did it once I don't want to do

it again oh with the book yes

yes don't do another one of it looks

look some people should it's just not

for me I I you just did it I know and it

and it almost killed me okay so that's

the first one but secondly yeah like

basically there's two ways to fix

procrastination one is you fix it's like

a picture you have a boat that's leaking

and it's not working very well you can

fix it in two ways you can get your

hammer and nails out and your boards and

actually fix the boat

or you can duct tape it for now to get

yourself across the river but it's not

actually fixed so ideally down the road

I have repaired whatever kind of bizarre

mental illness that I have that makes me

procrastinate in a very like I just

don't self-defeat in this way anymore

but in the meantime

I Can duct tape the boat by bringing

what I call the Panic monster into the

situation via things like this and this

scary person and having external

pressure to have external pressure of

some kind is critical for me uh it's

it's yes I don't have the muscle to do

the work I need to do without external

pressure by the way I live is there a

possible future where you write a book

and Meanwhile by the way huge

procrastinator that's the funny thing

about this yeah yeah I mean how long did

your last video take oh my God is there

advice would you do you give to Liv how

to get the videos done faster well it

would be the same exact thing I mean

actually I can give good procrastination

advice Panic monster

um well we should do it together it

should be like we have this date but

right you know it's it's um we're

actually just do another bet I have to

have my script done by this time yes

yeah if I go to get the third part out

because then you'll actually do it um

and um and and it's not the thing is the

time in but it's like if you if you

could take three weeks on a video and

instead you take 10 weeks it's not like

oh well I've also I'm having more fun in

those times you're the whole 10 weeks

bad so you're just you're just having a

bad time and you're getting less work

done and less work out it's not like

you're enjoying your personal life it's

bad for you for your relationships it's

bad for your your own you keep doing it

anyway yeah well a lot of people why do

people uh have troubles keeping a diet

right yeah primitive mind why'd you

point at me

what's your procrastination weakness do

you have one everything everything right

now everything it's everything preparing

for a conversation I had your book

amazing book I really enjoyed it I

started reading it

I was like this is awesome it's so

awesome that I'm going to save it when

I'm behind the computer and can take

notes like good notes of course that

resulted in like last minute everything

everything

I'm doing in my life not everyone's like

that you know people self-defeat in

different ways some people don't have

this particular problem Adam Grant is

that he calls himself a precrastinator

where he gets an assignment he will go

home and do it until it's done and

handed it which is also not necessarily

good you know it's like you're rushing

it either way but it's better but some

people have the opposite thing

um where they will um the the the the

the the looming deadline makes them so

anxious that they go and fix it right

and the procrastinator I think has a

similar anxiety but it they they resolve

it in a totally different way well they

don't solve it they just live with the

anxiety right right they deliver things

that now I think there's a even bigger

group of people so there's these people

that Adam grants there's people like me

and then there's people who have a

healthy relationship with deadlines but

they're still part of a bigger group of

people that actually they they um

they

need a deadline there to do something so

they actually they still are motivated

by a deadline and as soon as you have

all the things in life that don't have a

deadline like working out and like

working on that album you wanted to

write they don't do anything either so

there's actually like that's why

procrastination is a much bigger problem

Than People realize because it's not

just the funny last second people it's

anyone who

um actually can't get things done that

don't have a deadline

you dedicate your book quote to tandas

who never planned on being married to

someone who would spend six years

talking about his book on politics but

here we are uh what's the secret to a

successful relationship with a

procrastinator

that's maybe for both of you

um well I think the the first most

important thing you already started with

a political answer I could tell okay

good no no the first and most important

thing is because people who don't

procrastinate if you don't it's like you

will they people in the instinct is to

judge it as like uh

that's either either just think think

they're just being like a loser or

they're taking it they'll take it

personally you know uh and instead to

see this as like this is this is a uh

some form of

addiction or some form of ailment you

know they're not just being a dick right

like they have a problem and so so some

compassion but then also maybe finding

that line where you can you know maybe

apply some tough love some middle ground

on the other hand you might say that you

know you don't want the the significant

other relationship where it's like

they're into one nagging you maybe

that's you don't want them even being

part of that and I think maybe it's you

know better to have a live do it instead

right having someone who can like create

the infrastructure where they aren't the

direct stick you need a bit of carrot

and stick right maybe they can be the

person who keeps reminding them of the

carrot

and then they set up the friend group to

be the stick and then that keeps your

relationship yeah in a good steak like

looming in the background that's your

friend group okay at the beginning of

the conversation we talked about how all

of human history can be presented as a

thousand page book

uh what are you excited about for the

1000

what do you say that first page

uh so the next 250 years what are you

most excited about I'm most excited

about

um have you read the Fable of the Dragon

okay well it's an allegory for death and

it's you know Nick Bostrom and he talks

about the he Compares death to a dragon

that eats 60 million people or whatever

the number is every year and you just

every year we Shepherd those people up

and they feed him to the dragon and that

there's a Stockholm syndrome when we say

that's just a lot of man and that's what

we have to do and anyone who says maybe

we should try to beat the dragon they

get called Vain and narcissistic

um but someone who

tries to someone who goes does chemo no

one calls them Vayner narcissistic they

say they're they're you know good good

for you right you're a hero you're

you're fighting fighting the good fight

so I think there's some disconnect here

and I think that if we can

get out of that Stockholm syndrome and

realize that death is just the machine

the human physical machine failing and

that

there's no law of nature that says you

can't with enough technology

um uh repair the machine and keep it

going until no one I don't think anyone

wants to live forever people think they

do no one does but until people are

ready and I think when we hit a world

where we can ex we have enough Tech that

we can continue to keep the human

machine alive until the person says I'm

done I'm ready I think we will look back

and we will think that anything before

that time that'll be the real A.D BC you

know we'll look back at BC before the

big advancement and it'll seem so sad

and so heartbreaking barbaric and people

will say I can't believe

that humans like us had to live with

that when they lost loved ones and they

they died before they were ready I think

that's the ultimate achievement but we

need to stop

criticizing and smearing people who you

talk about it so you think where that's

actually doable in the next two 250

years

okay a lot happens in 250 years

especially when technology is really

exponentially yeah

and you think humans will be around

versus AI complete takes over whereas I

mean look The Optimist in me and maybe

the stupid kind of 2023 person in me

says yeah of course we'll we'll make it

we'll we'll figure it out but you know

I mean we are going into

um create you know I have a friend who

knows as much about the future as anyone

I know I mean he's really he's a big

investor and you know future Tech and he

um he's really on the puzzle things and

he just says Future's gonna be weird

that's what he says if you're just gonna

be weird

don't look at your the last few Decades

of your life and apply that for it and

say that's just what life is like no no

it's going to be weird and different

well some of my favorite things in this

world are weird and speaking of which

it's good to uh have this conversation

it's good to have you as friends this

- It was really shocking to me

that nobody else was doing

anything creative with sex work.

Like, for me it was like breathing,

like, you're just doing
sex and you're bored,

I'm like, "What do you do?"

"I dunno, let's try something funny."

Like, it's just the natural progression.

And it felt to me

like there was almost no competition.

Like I would just be really creative,

and, like, immediately it was the top

not safe post on Reddit.

I'm like, "Well, I didn't
even try that hard."

- The following is a
conversation with Aella,

a sex researcher

who does some of the largest

human sexuality survey
studies in the world

on everything from
fetishes to relationships.

She's fearless in pursuing
her curiosity on these topics

by asking challenging and
fascinating questions,

and looking for answers in
a rigorous data-driven way,

and writing about it on her blog,

KnowingLess.com.

She's also a sex worker,

including OnlyFans and escorting,

and is an exceptionally prolific creator

of thought-provoking Twitter polls.

Aella and I disagree on a bunch of things,

but that just made this conversation

even more interesting.

I like interesting people.

In the full range of the meaning

that the word interesting implies.

I'm currently reading

"On the Road" by Jack Kerouac,

and would be remiss if I didn't mention

one of my favorite quotes from that book

that feels relevant here.

"The only people for me are the mad ones,

"the ones who are mad to live,

"mad to talk, mad to be saved,

"desirous of everything at the same time,

"the ones who never yawn
or say a commonplace thing,

"but burn, burn, burn like
fabulous yellow Roman candles

"exploding like spiders across the stars.

"And in the middle you see
the blue center light pop,

"and everybody goes, 'Awww.'"

This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

in the description.

And now, dear friends here's Aella.

I feel like this
conversation can go anywhere.

Is that exciting or terrifying to you?

- I think it's more exciting.

- The uncertainty exciting to you?

- Yes.

- [Lex] In conversations in general

or just this one?

- I think conversations in general.

Like, does anybody like have a certainty

that's really exciting?

Maybe if the certainty is something new.

- I mean, novelty always
comes with uncertainty, right?

Almost always.

- That's right, I'm trying
to think of a counterexample.

- (chuckles) Immediately.

You're uncomfortable with
generalizations of that kind.

- Like, always is always
a really bold word to use.

- But if it's truly novel

that means you don't really understand it,

it's outside of your distribution.

So therefore it's gonna have

a bunch of uncertainty.

But you don't think of it as uncertainty,

you think about it as something new,

but it actually also attracts you

because there's a lot of
uncertainty surround it probably.

Like what is this new thing?
- Yeah.

Like, annihilating the mystery.

Like that drive.
- Yeah.

What about the danger of it?

- It's like, I was just
thinking of on the drive over

'cause I was like,

"I'm like a little nervous
about doing this podcast."

And then I was like feeling

into the unpleasantness of it.

Like the fear of what if
something goes terribly wrong?

And then I was also feeling into, like,

how much that feels like
part of why it's exciting.

Like, if I knew that it was
going to go great, I don't know.

- Did you actually imagine
all the possible ways

it can go wrong?

- Not like all of them, but I was like,

"What if I say something really dumb,

"or like you ask me a question
and I answer it in a way

"that makes me sound like a
lot less capable than I am."

I'm like really afraid of being perceived

as stupid or something.

I was also thinking about
this on the way over,

like, I'm kind of risk
averse in some ways,

I don't like driving fast in cars,

'cause I was driving very carefully here

'cause the roads are bad.

And then I was thinking about,

I'm very like pro risk in other ways,

like being really exposed to
like a wide variety of people

who might hate you.

And I think like from the
outside that might look fine,

but I think the monkey
brain is really sensitive

to lots of people yelling at you

for whatever problems
that you seem to have-

- So that's the big risk you're taking is

putting yourself out
there as an intellectual,

like through your writing

and then a lot of people yelling at you.

Is that the worst embarrassment

you're can experience?
- It's pretty bad, yeah.

I think the worst embarrassment
is if I put something

out there that I failed to
like be properly skeptical of

in myself and then people are like,

"Oh, we caught this thing
that you didn't catch."

I think that's the biggest terror.

- Yeah, from looking at
your reading and listening

to your interviews, you
seem to be very defensive

and worried about being a good scientist.

- [Aella] Yeah. Definitely.

- About you're methodology.

- [Aella] Yes.

- (chuckles) And funny enough,

you get attacked on that methodology

even though, you know,

I'm a fan of psychology, of
like the academic psychology,

and it's kind of disappointing
often how non-rigorous

their work is, how small
the sample size and so on,

and how big and ambitious, over ambitious,

the proclamations about results is,

especially when the news reports on it.

Now you're both the
researcher, the scientist,

and the reporter, (laughs) right.

So like that's what
you have with the blog.

Your sample size is often gigantic.

The methodology is right
there, the data's right there,

you provide the data and then
you're like raw and honest

with your interpretation of the data.

Like there's an honesty,
authenticity to it.

So it's actually really refreshing,

I don't know why people criticize it.

I think this is what psychologists

are probably terrified
about being transparent,

and transparent in that way is
because they'll get attacked

for their methodology,

so they wanna cloak it

in a sort of layer of authority.

"I'm from this institution,
it was peer reviewed,

"this kind of all these layers,
and I'm also not gonna share

"the data with you, and
I'm also gonna pretend

"like most psychology
studies and not replicable.

"I'm just going to pretend
there's authority to it."

- I think it works on a lot of people.

Like from the outside you're like,

"Ah, the scientists
with the white lab coats

"with credentials, those are the people

"who are like doing science."

And like doing science is, you know,

you have like fancy
terms that other people

don't really understand.

And to be fair, like
I have a lot to learn.

I'm still like, I'm self teaching,

I'm like learning through
people, learning as I go.

I'm definitely not super
knowledgeable about this stuff.

But a lot of what those people are doing

in science is not that hard.

And a lot of people like
don't try to learn it

because it seems so like elevated.

And this is one thing
that really bothers me,

I think, like, everybody can do science.

Like if you just have
this aspect of curiosity,

and like you just really
wanna figure something out,

you can go and start, you
know, asking people questions,

doing surveys, like
writing down the answers,

and then you can go learn
how to look at that data

in a way that gives you more
information about the world.

Like it's very simple and straightforward,

if you just approach it
humbly and earnestly,

you know, like, "Please let's
figure this out together."

But people like are, I
think, self crippled in this

because they view this as
like relegated to the domain

of the experts and, you
know, the fancy scientists.

And I think that makes me feel really sad.

- You're almost attracted to the questions

you're not supposed to ask.

- Oh yeah. Also, yes.

Which might contribute to the controversy.

- Not exclusively probably.
- Oh no.

- But you're just not limited by, like,

part of your curiosity is asking questions

that seem common sense.

Like some of the most
controversial questions

are like around sex.

It's like everybody thinks
and talks and does sex.

I mean, it's the driver
of human civilization,

and yet there's so little
like rigorous discussion

about, like, the philosophical

and the scientific questions around it.

It's like it gets really weird
to be able to discuss them.

It becomes tricky to discuss them.

- Yeah. It's supercharged.

'Cause everybody has a
really strong opinion,

like whether or not, you know,

pornography is damaging to society,

or like how sex corresponds to gender,

or like what kind of
sexuality is acceptable.

Like, can you have sexual preferences

that in themselves are immoral?

People get very angry about it.

- Well, the sad part is
they're not just opinionated,

but most of us, our
relationship with sex is,

I think, I guess I wanna say not rigorous.

- I think it's very difficult
to be rigorous about sex.

Like, I would consider sexual
urges to be kind of elusive

to introspection and in
a way that's a little bit

disproportionate to a lot of other things.

Like, you could like, you
know, introspect about

how I want other people
to like me and how,

where my insecurities lie.

But sex is one of those black box things.

A really common thing is for people to,

if you have a fetish,

you, sort of, check back in
your childhood to see an event

that corresponds to that fetish
and then you like develop

a narrative, like, "Ah,
this event in my childhood

"must have caused this fetish."

And so it causes people to be biased

towards like a concrete,
coherent causative way

that events happen, or that
sexual fetishes happen.

This is just like one
example of like why I think

it's really hard to be
rigorous with introspection

'cause we can't avoid,

you just wanna tend towards
making like coherent narratives.

Which I think is not always
the correct way to explain it.

- The narratives that are
connected to childhood and so on

how they originate? Yeah.
- Yeah.

- I mean we'll talk about fetishists

'cause you have a lot of really
interesting writing on that.

Just actually zooming out,

I should mention you
tweeted, I wrote this down,

you tweeted, "I do not
understand how to have

"normal conversations
with people in person

"if I'm not on drugs."

So I guess let's both agree

to not have a normal
conversation, I guess.

Assuming you're not on
drugs now, or if you are

you don't have to tell me.

- I tool like a very
small amount of phenibut

which is a nootropic.

I dunno if that counts.

- Is that a drug?

Well, I guess I'm on caffeine.

Yeah.
- So we're both?

- Drugged up.

- We're good enough to
have a normal conversation.

- We don't have to.

What is normal anyway?

What do you think is the primary driver

of human civilization?

Is it the desire for sex,
love, power, or immortality?

Like avoiding the fear of death,

constructing illusions that make us forget

about our terror over mortality.

So sex, love, power, death?

- Is a Twitter poll?

Is more options. (laughs)
- This is reality.

Not everything maps perfectly
into a Twitter poll.

But in this case because
there's four options

and it is a small number
of characters, it does.

But I'd like to think I am more,

you know what, I think your Twitter polls

are fundamentally interesting.

There's something about
the brevity of a poll

limiting to a set of choices

and having an existential crisis

and searching for the
answer that's beautiful.

- That combination-
- Well, this one is a big one.

Like what do you think is behind it?

- Do you believe that there
is one primary driver?

Like, do you think that
it can be understood

in the terms of primary drivers?

- Yeah, I think, well maybe
it's an engineering perspective,

like trying to reverse engineer the brain.

I don't think we're equipped
or understand enough

about the mind to get there-

- Yeah, like what's the
primary driver of a tree?

- Yeah. Well then it gets to
the question of what is life?

What is a living organism?

- To self-replicate, probably.

- That's a very clean simplification,

but I think life is more interesting

than just self-replication.

- Yeah. But it sounds like
there's a curiosity in you

that you're trying to like poke at,

and I don't understand exactly
what that curiosity is.

- So if I had to dedicate
1,000 years to understand

one of these topics, which one
would be the most fruitful,

I guess, is the indirect thing I'm asking?

- Fun.

- No, well fun.

To me everything is fun, but (laughs).

- [Aella] Really?

- Yeah.

I mean, I'm with David Foster Wallace.

The key to life is to make sure
that everything's unborable

or should be unborable, nothing is boring,

everything is fun.

Like everything, I could
just literally sit,

I honestly, 'cause I don't think,

I don't know where you got that glass,

but that glass exists
and I forgot it exists,

and it was really fun to me
to know that now it's there.

- But let's talk about like
really unpleasant things.

Like, if you're in like a deep agony.

- Yeah, that's fun.
- Okay.

- That's fun 'cause it's like,

I mean, yeah, heartbreak,

it's like knowing that
I'm capable of that.

It like, from, (laughs) you know,

we're all living in the gutter,

but some of us are
looking up at the stars.

So when you're in that gutter

for some reason the stars
look brighter, right.

So, like, whenever you're
going through a difficult time,

or whenever you see maybe other people

being shitty to each other,

it makes you like really
appreciate when they're not.

The contrast makes life kind of amazing.

I'm reading a bunch of books,

and one of them is "Brave New World"

where they remove, you know,

where they remove the
ups and downs of life,

partially through drugs
but over sexualization

and all that kind of stuff.

And I feel like you need that,

you need the ups and downs
of life, the dark, you know,

you need the dark to have happiness,

to have like a deeply
intense feeling of affection

towards another thing
or a human being. Yeah.

Yeah. So everything's fun.

But fun is also a weird word to define

'cause fun I think for a lot of people.

That's why I talk about love a lot,

I think love is a better word than fun,

'cause fun is like lighthearted,
love is more intense.

Like, I love that glass
and the water that's in it

'cause it's freaking awesome.

Like, somebody made that glass, right?

And, like, not have many
mistakes, and like there's a,

and the way it bends
light in interesting ways,

and the way water bends
light in interesting ways.

Like, I can see part of
your arm through that water,

that's freaking amazing.

Everything is amazing. (laughs)

I'm with the "Lego Movie". Anyway.

But if, like, from a
scientific perspective,

if I were to investigate sex,

I don't know why I put love in there,

let's just narrow down the Twitter poll,

let's focus on the basics here;

sex, power or death, immortality.

If I were to try to,

like, from a neuroscience,
neurobiology perspective

or reverse engineer
through building AI systems

that focus on these kinds of dynamics,

exploring the game
theoretic aspects of it,

exploring the sort of cognitive
modeling aspects of it,

which one would get me
to a deeper understanding

of the human condition?

That's the question.

Sex? Okay, Nietzsche is the will to power.

Freud and the bunch is all about sex,

and then death, Liv just Liv Boeree,

brilliant previous guest on this podcast,

she's just released a
video where on her bedside

was the book "Denial of
Death" by Ernest Becker,

which, of course, she
would have on her bedside.

But his whole work is that
everything is motivated

by our trying to escape
the cold, harsh reality

that we're going to die
and we're terrified of it.

One of the gifts and
burdens for human beings

is that we are cognizant of our own death

and that terrifies us.

That's the theory.

And because of that we
do everything we can;

we build empires to escape
the fact that we're mortal.

- Wouldn't this change quite a
bit for religious people then

who don't believe that
they're going to die?

- Well, they created religion,

the idea there to create myths, religions,

you can create religions
of all kinds, like-

- Yeah. But if this is like
one of the defining things

that define civilization,

then we should expect to
see like massive differences

between people who believe are gonna die

and people who don't.

- Good. I love it

you to give like a
scientifically here but,

and have actually answers.

Like there's a whole terror
management theory where they do

write psychology-type papers
and they do actual experiments.

I can mention how their
methodology is interesting.

They prime with the discussion of death;

like they take one certain set of people,

they have a conversation with them,

and another set of people
they mention death to them

before the conversation to
see how that affects their,

the nature of that conversation.

It's really interesting 'cause
death fundamentally alters

the nature of the conversation.

Just even priming, like, reminding you

that you're going to die
briefly changes a lot of things.

- These kinds of priming
papers usually not replicated.

I just have like,

I feel like I've heard a
bunch of primary ones that.

- [Lex] I think you have PTSD over

psychology papers that's not replicated.

- I just did one, I just did
a priming experiment on my own

and found it didn't have any effect.

But again it's not the same-
- Can't you just give me

perilous statement summarizing

an entire scientific discipline
of terror management theory.

I don't know.

People should, like, I haven't
rigorously looked at how good

of it psychologically.

I think it is interesting philosophically

the way Freud talked about
the subconscious mind,

philosophically it's an
interesting discussion.

Then you have to get
rigorous with each for sure.

But (laughs) the idea is that,

like, it's not that religious people

get rid of the terror of death.

This is just one of the popular
ways they create an illusion

on top of it,

that's that idea, like,
a myth that allows,

that makes it easier for them to forget

to escape that terror.

But everybody else does different methods,

like you feel your days
with, like, capitalism

is a whole religion of itself.

Like the rat race for
getting more and more

material possessions and so on.

- Then couldn't you argue
in the opposite direction?

Like, let's say assume
that we're Christians here

and we're like, the atheists, you know,

everybody has terror of
hell and the atheist invent

this mythology where, you know,
actually evolution is true

in order to escape their terror of hell.

So that doesn't feel like a
persuasive argument to me.

But I used to be very, very Christian,

and I did not have a terror of death.

And then I lost my faith,
and then I had a deep terror

of death set in for a few years.

And it felt very different to me.

- Well, so for "Denial of Death",

I don't know if he says
that it's actually possible

without really a lot of work
to get to the actual terror.

Like, I think his claims

that in early, early, early
childhood development,

that's when the terror is real,

and then we aggressively construct systems

around it of social interaction

to sort of construct
illusions on top of it.

I'm doing a half-ass
description of this philosophy,

but like, it isn't interesting to simplify

the human mind into underlying mechanisms

that drive it.

- Yeah, I was gonna say your
thinking seems kind of poetic,

like the way that you're sort
of handling these concepts

feel like more like aesthetically driven-

- I think this theme is gonna continue

throughout conversation as we talk

about relationships and sex.

Yes, for sure. I think so.

And I think your thinking
seems to be very driven

by how can I construct an experiment

to test this hypothesis?

- Yeah, something like that.

- Yeah. But there's some things,

especially that have to
do with the human mind

that are really messy,

really difficult to understand,

there's so many uncertainties
and mysteries around

that we don't yet have the
tools to collect the data.

Like, one of your favorite
tools is the survey,

is asking people questions,
and then figuring out

different ways to indirectly
get the at the truth

because there's flaws to the survey.

You kind of learn about those flaws

and you get better and better
at asking the right questions

and so on.

But that's not, that's indirect
access to the human mind.

- But do you think like
poetic narratives are?

I'm not like saying
poetic narratives are bad.

Like, I think it's like a cool way

of like handling concepts,

but I'm not sure that
they are more rigorous.

- No, no, no.
- Okay.

- No, but like they might
be the more correct,

like philosophy might be the
right way to discuss things

that we're really far from understanding.

- Yeah. I mean they might
be a more useful shorthand.

Yeah. Like morality,

like, I don't think
morality makes any sense,

but it's really useful
shorthand to use when handling

concepts in a lot of the time.

- Right. Like ethics and morality.

You could construct studies
that ask different questions

like, you know, just having
worked with autonomous vehicles

a lot the trolley problem gets brought up,

and I don't know, you can construct

all kinds of interesting surveys
about the trolley problem,

but does that really get
at some deep moral calculus

that humans do?

It's sexy because people like write

click-bait articles about it,

but does it really get to
like what you value more,

five grandmas or like
three children or whatever,

like they construct
these arguments of like,

if you could steer a train,

if you could steer an autonomous car,

which do you choose?

Yeah, I don't know.

I don't know if it's
possible with some of those

to construct.

Like, sometimes the fuzzy area,

there's some topics that are
fuzzy and will forever be fuzzy

given our limited cognitive capabilities.

- I dunno, there's a
way of looking at things

where it's like, for example
the childhood fetish thing

that I was talking about,

like, where do your fetishes come from?

Like, you can develop a
narrative where it's like,

you know I think like this
kind of thing is, you know,

when you're surrounded by
feet when you're a child,

this caused foot fetishes.

And this is like kind of a cool narrative.

And I think a lot of people's
ideas about philosophy

follow the same sort of thing.

Like what is the narrative that is cool?

And I think this is
useful for meaning making,

like, I'm very pro meaning-making.

Like when you're talking
about everything is fun

because you know the contrast or whatever.

I very much ascribed to that,

I really enjoy that philosophy.

I also find everything
to be very delightful.

But, and this isn't like a
question of truth, right,

we're not, like, where's the true delight

that we're objectively measuring?

Like, this is a frame, a poetic frame,

that you're using to like sort of change

the way the light hits
the world around you.

And that's super useful

because it, like, makes
you happier or something.

- Yeah. But also gets to
the truth or something.

- [Aella] Yeah. I guess
what is the truth? (laughs)

- Yet another question. What is truth?

You've, actually, to jump back,

you believe that free will is an illusion.

So why does it feel like "

"I'm free to make any decision I want?

- Well, it's a cool illusion.

I think it's probably,
like, where our sense

of identity comes.
- It's a fun illusion. Oh.

- Like, when you really meditate
on your sense of identity,

at least for me it
seems like it comes down

to the sense of choice,

like, "Oh I am doing the thinking."

Like, what does it mean
to do with thinking?

It's like, "Ah, something
in me has exerted agency

"over having this thought
or not having this thought."

Like the sense of self
really comes down to choice.

And so when I say that, like,
free will is an illusion,

I also mean there's something
like the self is an illusion,

identity is a trick of the light.

- But it's a really fun one.
- Yeah.

- You think a lot about your identity?

- [Aella] I have occasionally.

- Yeah. Like you really struggle with it.

You're proud of it. I do too.

It's not, we have
different journeys but, so-

- I really take a lot of delight in it.

I used to be very into
like deconstructing it,

like maybe you know, I
did a bunch of, like,

way too much LSD for a while,

and at that point very, no ego.

And now I'm like very ego,

and I really enjoy having a lot of ego.

- I actually happen to know
like everything about you.

- Really? Wow.
- Yeah.

Like more than you do, it's interesting.

- That's fascinating.

Wait, can you solve my problems?

- Yes. All of them, I
did thorough research.

Okay. What is consciousness then?

I actually wrote that as a
quote, what is consciousness?

(both chuckling)

To remind myself?

So like how's that tie in
together with free will

and identity and all of that.

- What is consciousness is like

one of the biggest questions ever.

I think, I do think that
people often get confused

when talking about consciousness.

'Cause I think people are
referring to two separate concepts

and often, like, combining
them into one thing.

Like we asked a question, you know,

is AI going to be conscious?

And I think this is kind
of the wrong question.

Like we can identify
signs of consciousness,

like, "Ah, they seem to
refer to themselves,"

but this is not necessarily
proof of consciousness

in the same way that like dream characters

acting exactly the way
normal human people do,

in your dream is not evidence

that they themselves are conscious.

So like signs of consciousness

are not proof of consciousness.

But there is something
that we definitely know,

which is, like, I currently am conscious,

I can tell because right,

I'm, like, just directly
observing my experience.

And so, like, there's one kind
of consciousness which is,

"I am directly observing my experience,"

and that you cannot replicate it.

Like, I cannot observe two experiences,

it is necessarily singular
and it is necessarily certain.

Like, you can make all
the arguments you want,

like, I'm still directly observing,

it's not a thing that's subject to reason.

Whereas our other thing is conscious,

this is something that's replicable,

like, you can apply it to multiple people,

it's something that's not certain,

like almost definitionally not certain.

Like, we don't actually
know if there is, you know,

an internal experience.

So my argument is that like
when people are talking about

other things having experience,

they're using a different
concept than the thing

that they're actually
looking at when they look at

their own experience.

I think they're two different things.

- Definitionally not possible.

No, if you understand the
mechanism of consciousness,

you'll be able to measure
it probably, right?

- Yeah. But what are you measuring?

Like, I think there's
like a subtle difference.

Like, when you're asking the question,

"Is this other thing conscious?"

- Yeah. The easy thing to
measure is like a survey.

Does this thing appear conscious?

- [Aella] Yeah.

- And then the hard
thing is you understand

the actual mechanism of
how consciousness arises

in the physics

of the human brain-
- Yeah, but you

do it in a dream presumably.

Like, if you had a very good
dream, a very good simulation.

But we could then have somebody
in a simulation or a dream

where they go through and they
fully understand, you know,

they do all the tests and
the tests come back exactly

the way they would expect them to.

But from the outside we're like,

"Well this is misleading,
they're not actually conscious."

Like, your dream characters
aren't conscious,

right, probably.

- I don't know, are you
asking or are you telling?

- I'm, like appealing to an intuition.

(both chuckling)

- But it sounds like you're
driving towards the narrative.

You did a poll about men
and women and dreams.

- [Aella] Yeah.

- Those had some kind of difference.

I couldn't tell what the difference was

except that more men than women-

- Quite a lot more women
dream vividly than men.

- Oh!
- Which I actually found

in my chaos survey.

So I did a survey, maybe you know,

I just had people-
- I know everything, remember?

- You do know, yes. I'm sorry.

So as you clearly know-

- I'll try not to talk down to you

through this conversation.

'cause I know, and I not
only know everything,

I know how your future looks like-

- [Aella] Really?

- And how everything ends. Yeah.

- So you could probably win
all the prediction markets

on my life.
- Yeah.

- Cool.

- So we should also mention

that you have like prediction markets.

You have like votes that you,

what's the site called again?

- Manifold.
- Manifold.

And one of them was,

"Will I be on the Lex Fridman podcast?"

- [Aella] Yeah.

- And I voted.

I invested everything I own into the yes.

Is there such thing as
insider trading on there?

Does that goes against the terms of the-

- No, I think insider trading
is part of the information.

So it's supposed to be.
- Oh, I see.

And then I realized it's
actually public information

that I voted, 'cause, like, I
think my face shows up there.

I was like, "Dammit"

It's gonna influence-
- Fake account.

- You could make the fake account,

or I could be lying, right?

- Yeah, that's true.
- And then dump

the stock or whatever.

- You know, I tried to manipulate,

somebody made a market, like,

"Is Aella going to post
a pole," spelled P-O-L-E,

"on her Twitter?"

Like a photo.

And I was like, "I'm gonna
manipulate this market."

So I like fucked around
with it and I voted no.

And then I accidentally
posted a photo of a pole

without thinking, so it's like

a double poll.
- Like self-sabotage.

- Yeah, I accidentally,
fucked up my own market.

- That's like the reverse
of insider trading.

- [Aella] Yeah. (chuckles)

- What were we talking about?

Oh, the women and the
men and the difference,

the vivid dreams and the markets.

I forget what the market,

oh 'cause I can perfectly
predict your future.

But then it's not fun.

I like the romance of unpredictability,

and so I like to, even
though I know everything,

I like to forget everything.

- Yeah.
- Very, very Buddhist of you.

- Yeah. The river.

"No, no man in the river wants, whatever,

"the footsteps," however that goes.

- That's one of my
favorite questions is like,

if you could press a button and then have

all of your wants fulfilled,
anything that you want?

So it's like such a rapid degree

that you don't really experience the want.

Like as the want arises,

it then is like completed as immediately,

so that you are completely without want.

Like, would you press that button?

- [Lex] 100% not.

- Yeah, I didn't think you would.

- No, no, no, no.

Because immediately
everything starts being fun.

The first, it's only fun the first time.

- But you want it to be fun.

- But, like, what would
be my source of fun?

I feel like I would've, like,
on day four just to get off,

I would need to like do like nuclear war

'cause it'll escalate quickly.

(both laughing)

I feel like if everything
is, I assume you mean, like,

something that like is not
just normal human things but-

- Yeah. Magical world.
- Magical world.

Then you start escalating really quickly.

Like I wonder, I'll probably do like,

I want everybody to just fly into the air

and hover in the air. Everybody.

And then you're like,
"Oh, life is meaningless.

"Like why does, like, you
go, I feel like you get..."

No, I actually, that'd be a
really interesting experiment,

like what are the limits?

Like, are we all capable

of becoming psychopaths, essentially?

Like, I like to believe not,

there's a very hard limits on
that, like in our own mind,

like of basic compassion,

'cause I love being compassionate

towards other human beings.

And it's one of the things I think about

if you give me power, like a lot of power,

like absolute power, and I
think the power you mentioned

is the scariest kind of power.

'Cause it's like, it's not even
power in this normal world,

it's like magical power where you lose,

it's a dream world power where
you, like video game power,

you don't even think of it as reality.

You could just mess with the world.

And I feel like that's terrifying.

- Yeah, you'd basically be God.

- God yeah, but without, like...

I feel like the idea of God wants, like,

keep the things like functioning properly?

- But then you would probably would,

if you wanted to keep
them functioning properly.

Then it would rapidly,

like you would never experience
a time where you're like,

"Oh no, that was a mistake because, like,

before you even experienced that

the world would shift to match it.

- Oh, interesting.

No, I think I would
actually, I take it back.

I think I would regret the
first time I hurt somebody.

See in my visualization
it was like a video game

where everybody's like NPC really dumb.

No, I think the first time
I witness pain from anybody,

that's when I would stop.

And I would probably run
into that very quickly.

(chuckles) Like even just the hovering,

make a person hover and
then I'm gonna be probably

really upset with the hovering, right.

And so I'm gonna be like,

"No, don't do that anymore." (laughs)

And then I'll probably go to, honestly,

I'll just return back to my normal life.

- Yeah. That's kind of what I feel like,

like if I had the power to do anything,

I think I would probably want
to have a life very similar

to where I am now.

- Yeah.

Yeah. I mean there's, it's like with Uber,

like, it'd be probably more
convenient to do certain things,

but even then, like the struggle,

like I got a flat tire
so I had to fix that.

Kind of, the flat tire makes
everything more beautiful.

It's like, "Cool, I could do
like a normal manual thing."

But also it makes you
like appreciate your car,

appreciate transportation,
appreciate the convenience,

the transportation, all of it.

- I know some people who would, like,

call this a bunch of copium,

like you're just sort of
making due with what you have.

Like we wouldn't go back to Amish times

or like pre-technology because to like,

in order to make ourselves
appreciate things more,

and so this seems like
a hindsight reasoning.

Which, like, I can
appreciate that argument,

but I don't know, I'm like-

- Anyone who uses, sorry to interrupt,

the word copium in their argumentation

I think is suss-
- Is suss.

Yeah.
- Is suss

my entire argument now?

- No, I'm just kidding. I'm sorry.

Just go ahead.

Sorry. I interrupted
rudely the flow of thought.

But, so you don't think so?

In part you disagree with
that kind of argument?

- Yeah. 'Cause I think
people have this idea

that if you like come to
accept or like find meaning

in what you have now,

this is sort of at odds
with trying to improve it

and I don't find this to be the case.

I find like the attempt to
improve it to also be part of it.

Like I enjoy the fact that
there's something, like,

problematic going on because
now I get the experience

of like striving to make it go away.

And like that in itself
is where the meaning lies.

It's not just that things are bad,

it's that there's things are bad

and we're trying to stop it, and to also-

- Exactly. If you combine
that with a sense of optimism

that the future can be better.

Yeah. That feeds into
this productive effort

of making things better.

And it somehow makes
the vision of the things

that are better, more intense,

having experienced shitty things.

- Yeah.

- So we talked about free
will and consciousness

and what drives human civilization.

Question left unanswered.

It's a homework problem for the reader.

Okay.

- I get like a scoreboard at the end,

the amount of questions?

- That we didn't answer.
- Complete successfully

versus not.

- Like polls?
- Yeah.

- Can we talk about some practical things?

- [Aella] Sure.

- So one of the many amazing things,

I think of you as a researcher,

but you've also been doing
research in the field.

- Yeah. Field work. (chuckles)
- Field work.

- The Jane Goodall

of sex work.
- Yeah. Yeah, right-

- How did you get, what's
the short and the long story

of how you got into sex work?

- How did I get into sex work?

Well, I mean there's a
whole like childhood thing

where I was conservatively homeschooled.

- Do you wanna actually
talk about your childhood?

I think it's interesting
'cause you also worked

in a factory.

It's like your childhood
is really fascinating

and difficult, traumatic.

So, and you've written about it,

there's a lot of ways
we can talk about it.

But maybe, what are the
things you remember,

the good and the bad of your childhood,

of your, maybe, interaction
with your father?

- Yeah, my dad probably has

narcissistic personality disorder.

And so it was very centered

on very controlling
childhood, immensely so.

We were homeschooled
and kind pretty isolated

from the outside world,

like, we didn't know anybody
else who wasn't homeschooled.

We went through a program
called Growing Kids God's Way,

which was very, is like
the kind of program

where you're not supposed to
pick up babies when they cry

to train them that they
can't manipulate the parents.

Because, like, a baby
crying was viewed as like,

you're just teaching
them from an early age

that they're allowed
to make the parents do

what the kids want.

And they're very against this philosophy.

So, you know, that combined

with a narcissistic personality disorder,

dad was pretty rough.

- So controlling.
- Super controlling. Yeah.

- And developing and feeding
the self-critical aspect

of your brain.

- Yeah, very much.

It was, you know, I was like lazy

but I was never gonna
accomplish anything in life.

I was gonna move out of
the house and realize

how good I had it at home.

You know, the classic stuff.

He was very like logical and smart though,

and so he'd also like
teach us logic stuff.

I remember some of my earliest memories

of him like giving me basic logic puzzles.

Like the dog has three legs,

you know, how many dogs have four legs,

and I would mess up and,
but he was a evangelist,

basically a Christian evangelist.

So we had, like, bible
study five nights a week.

I memorized I think
800 verses of the Bible

by the time before I became an adult.

Yeah, and it was very patriarchal also,

so I was expected to become
a housewife basically.

They're like, "Oh you can
go to college to meet a man

"and also to get a little bit of education

"so that you can
homeschool your own kids."

Like we were explicitly told that women

were subordinate to men in regards

to, like, making decisions
when you're married.

Our pastor's daughter was
not allowed to leave home

because she would be outside
of the authority of a man.

So when she got married
she was allowed to leave,

'cause she was never
allowed to live in a house

where she was not under a hierarchy.

So this is like the kind of
culture that we lived in.

- So there's a hierarchy

and there's a gender
aspect to the hierarchy,

there's men at the top of that hierarchy.

- [Aella] Men at the top.

- Okay. But your own
psychology and your own mind,

so most of that self-critical
brain is bad, right.

- It was confusing 'cause he
told me I that I was smart

but also that I would fail.

But I think-
- But not smart enough, right?

You're like smart but not smart enough.

- Smart but like not
virtuous or something.

- Okay. So there's okay,
right, there's always a flaw.

- (chuckles) There's always a flaw.

I think a lot of it was,
a lot of the fuckedupness

of my brain came from feeling

like I didn't have the authority to think

'cause it was so like
carefully, like, suppressed.

Like, my ability to like express
or have any sort of power

was just absolutely
annihilated, like systemically.

Like psychologically, they would do

like psychological torture
mechanisms to make sure

that, like, I wasn't
actually thinking on my own,

or like being able to deviate

from anything anybody ever told me,

to the degree that it's
still ingrained in me.

Like, I once was with a friend,

we were traveling and he
wanted me to hop a turn style.

It was like very late at night,

the train was here and I could not

physically force myself to do it.

Like, he was, like, yelling, at me,

"Come on, do it."

Like, "No", but I was trying so hard

to make my body cross
the line and it was just,

it's like embedded in my physical being

to like be unable to do stuff like that,

which is really annoying.

- So you're not free to
take action in this world.

- Yeah. Some of it.

So that was, I think,

the most annoying part of my upbringing.

- Would you classify
it as, like, suffering?

- At the time, yeah, definitely.

Well, it's confusing 'cause like

when I was a child it was just painful

in the sense that, like, things suck,

but it was placed in a
meaning framework, right.

Like it is good, it is virtuous
to submit to your parents

and do what they want.

If they tell you to say
goodbye to your best friend

forever and never talk to them again,

you go do that without complaining.

And so like I would go
do something like that,

and I would, like, it would suck,

it really was like concretely painful,

but it was also placed in this
narrative where I was like

fulfilling some sort of greater purpose.

- [Lex] Sure.

- And so it's very confusing
to refer to it as suffering

because there's so many
painful things we do today

that are placed in the
narrative of a greater purpose

that, like, I think I would agree with.

Like, I go get a medical
procedure done, that sucks,

but I'm like, "Ah, this is
helping me in the long run."

But like say if I got
abducted to an alien planet

and they're like,

"By the way all of those
medical procedures you got done,

"like you didn't have to get them done,

"those are totally unnecessary."

Then I might get really upset about it.

- Yeah. I wouldn't trust
those aliens though

'cause they probably wanna do different

medical procedures.
- This is true. (chuckles)

- I saw a thumbnail for a
video that I'm proud of myself

for not clicking on about
a man who has claimed

that he had sex with aliens.

And I also thought-
- And how do you feel

for not clicking on it?

- 'Cause I was wondering,

'cause I would probably
watch it for like 20 minutes

and then I should be doing work.

- [Aella] Oh, I see.

- So like, and I'm actually
happy 'cause I get to imagine

all the different possibilities
that could have been

for that man who had sex with aliens.

- You have like a really high, like,

resting happiness state?

- Yes. Yeah.

That's probably like a
mushroom state, yeah.

- [Aella] Wow. Do you do mushrooms?

- I've done mushrooms before.

It was very awesome.
- Cool.

- But like more intensely awesome.

But, like good because I
was just looking at nature,

it makes nature even
more beautiful I think.

But it's already pretty beautiful.

I haven't done MBMA.

People say that I should.
- It's very nice. Yeah.

- Yeah. Anyway, I'm
already, yeah, (chuckles)

what did you call it?

Resting happiness state?

- [Aella] Yeah. High resting happiness.

- Yeah. That's a good way to describe it.

But it's not like, some of it is genetic

that you're able to notice
the beauty in the world,

and some of it is
practiced where you realize

focusing on the negative things in life,

like unproductively is,

it just doesn't help your mind flourish.

So like you just notice
that and it's like,

I mean, I think people with
like depression learn that,

or like probably with
trauma too, it's like,

there's certain triggers.

Like if you suffer from depression,

you have to kind of consciously
know there's going to be

triggers that will, like,
force you to spiral down.

And so just avoid those triggers.

Some people have that with
diet, with food and so on.

And so I just don't like,

whenever there's shady things
happening or shady people,

unless I can help.

Unless I can somehow help,
like, why focus on it.

Yeah. Anyway.

Back to your up upbringing.

What was the journey of escaping that?

- Well, I left home like
kind of early because my dad

and I were not getting along by the time

I was a teenager.

But I was still Christian for a while,

and I lost my faith after
I think I moved away

and I started having friends
that weren't religious,

so like weren't raised

in the super conservative
environment that I came from.

And I think, this was not
conscious at the time,

this was my hindsight story,
but I believe that, like,

being exposed to a culture in which

I had the capacity to
believe, like allowed my brain

to actually seriously consider
the thought that maybe

all of this stuff was untrue,

that I'd been taught
like 6,000 year old Earth

and evolution is a lie,
you know, macroevolution

and all of this stuff.

Because, like, when you're immersed

in an environment like that,

I don't think you actually have a choice.

Like, your brain has
to believe these things

'cause this is a survival thing.

Like, if you believe this, you'll be,

like, if you believe the wrong thing,

you'll be totally cast out.

Even if they're not gonna cast you out,

you're gonna be cast out in
like communing with others,

because we were always told
that you can't like trust

non-believers really;

they don't have a moral compass,

they're gonna screw you over.

And so I'm like, "Oh, I can't be that,

"like, everybody's gonna
outcast me internally."

So anyway, I don't think I
actually had the capacity

to seriously question my faith,

even though I thought that I
was questioning it quite hard

until I got into an environment
where it was safe to do so.

And once I started being
able to make friends

who were not religious, I'm like,

"Oh, if I lose my faith,

"I'm still gonna have
some sort of community."

And then at that time I went
through some questioning

and then I lost my faith.

- So in that, given your
friends, given your situation,

you now have the freedom
to think essentially.

- Or at least the ability
to think of something

that was acceptable in
the new culture. Yeah.

- Without, I mean, is there
a danger of like adopting

the beliefs of the new culture?

So like there's some aspect

of just being able to think freely,

which you weren't able to
do when you were growing up.

Just to think, like, look
at the world and wonder

how it works, that kind of thing.

- Well, I mean you work it
within certain boundaries,

like, there's certain basic assumptions,

and as long as you were following
those basic assumptions,

which is, to be fair, is like
kind of what we're doing now.

Like we have, have I gone
done the personal research

that, like, evolution is
the thing that's going on,

have I looked at like
the age of the stones?

No, I haven't, I'm trusting other people.

Which I think is like
a fair choice to make

given where I'm at right now.

- But you're also assuming, like,

there's causality in the
universe, time is real.

- Yeah.

- That first of all,

the thing that your senses
are perceiving is real.

You're assuming a lot of things.

- (laughs) Yeah. I think like
it's better just to become

aware of the assumptions you're making,

like, as opposed to not making
those assumptions at all.

Like, you have to assume something.

And I did, it's very suspicious right,

that I went out of this
very conservative culture,

and now I, well I guess
I don't believe things

that are super in line
with the current culture.

I think this is why I feel
a little bit safer right now

because, like, when I was Christian,

I believe generally Christian things.

But now I believe a bunch of things

that, like, people really hate.

Like, I get canceled online all the time.

I'm like, "Okay, this is a sign that maybe

"you're thinking independently
if you're like able

"to think things that
are completely at odds

"with the people around you."

And, to be fair, this is
a little bit easier to do

when it's like general culture.

But it's much harder to
do with your peer group;

like the people that
you trust, your friends,

the people whose opinions you respect.

Like, disagreeing with those
people is very difficult

and I'm not very good at it.

- Yeah. I do think that
if you establish yourself

as a person who can be trusted
and is a good human being,

you have a lot more freedom
to then explore ideas

that are different from your peer group.

So like, those seem like, if
you separate the space of ideas

versus some kind of like deeper sense

of what this person is, like
that they're an interesting

and trustworthy and good human being.

- Well, like, is there
somebody that you respect

who you think they're
significantly smarter than you?

And can you imagine believing
an idea that you've heard them

talk really disdainfully about?

Like, how would you feel coming to me,

like, I believe this
thing that you find to be.

- Yeah, I do all the time.

- Oh. Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

- Maybe you're braver than me.

(both laughing)

And to be fair, I support doing this,

like I try to do this,

but I think, like, subconsciously I notice

that I don't do it as much, and
so I'm suspicious of myself.

I'm like, "Oh, I wonder
if I'm hiding to myself,

"like actual curiosity about things

"that might deviate from my peer group."

Because I noticed that I'm not
actually deviating with them

as much as I do with the outside world.

- Yeah, that's interesting.

I mean, like, 'cause I do see
most people I interact with

are smarter than me,

but I also have this intuitive
feeling that dumb people,

which I consider myself
being, have wisdom.

So like in the disagreement, actually,

I also believe in the
power of conversation

and the tension of disagreement.

So I think I even just
disagreeing from a place,

from a good place, from a
place of like love and respect

for each other, I think
I just believe in that.

So it's not like individuals,
you're disagreeing,

you're like working towards arriving

at some deeper truth together, right.

Even if the other person is smarter.

Maybe that's how I justify it for myself.

I just, I'm also a fan of conversations

'cause like I've seen, just
listening to conversations,

it seems like a great
conversation more emerges from it

than the sum of its parts, right.

Like somehow two people together can do,

like, that dance of ideas can
somehow create a cool thing.

By the way, I enjoyed,

I saw a video of you
dancing at a bar drunk.

(Aella laughing)

It wasn't a bar drunk,
you didn't look drunk,

but just the dancing,

it was like ballroom
dancing type of thing.

I was like-
- Yeah.

- Yeah.
- Something like that.

- I've been doing a bit of
tango dancing, I like it.

- Argentine?
- Hmm.

- Nice.

- I like stuff with the body in general,

like wrestling or combat, like,

usually when there's a
tension you have to understand

the mechanics of how two bodies move

when they're in conflict,

and dancing is similar. (laughs)

- Like you have to do
like rapid thinking also,

like rapid, intuitive, physical thinking.

And that's my favorite kind of thing.

Like a lot of exercise
is really boring to me

because you can just do
it while your brain's off.

But something like ballroom
dancing or fusion dancing, like,

you have to constantly
be like figuring out,

like, it's a rapid puzzle,

and that's so wonderful.

- What's fusion dancing?

- That's the video.

Fusion dancing is like,

if you have any sort of dance background,

you can come and you just
kind of mix those together.

- Oh, just like improvise.
- So you can have people

doing ballet, with people doing ballroom,

with people doing blues.

- Cool. And then there's
an interesting dynamic

'cause there's, I don't know,
maybe you can correct me,

but there's, ah, that's very meta,

there's usually a lead and a follow.

I guess most dancers have that.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

But both have a, like you both
have to be quite sensitive

to the other human being,
but in a different way.

Yeah. It's interesting.

- [Aella] Yeah.

- So I like both that there
is that definitive role,

but also like, it's not
somehow that one is better

than the other, there's
a interesting tension

between the two.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

- It's good because it's
like a basic rule set

that allows for a ton of expression.

I've recently started to experiment

with like reverse leading.

It's not like back leading, it's like,

I don't know, like sometimes I was like

lead and move-
- So you can lead

or just follow.

Oh, you can lead.

- Well, I'm typically following.

I'll, like, occasionally
throw in a little lead

here and there, which-

- But don't you kind of follow?

Oh, I see.

But don't you hint at a
lead when you're following?

Like, don't you just by the
dynamics of your movement,

you're not perfectly following.

I mean, 'cause there is
like, the lead is listening

to your body, right?
- Yeah.

- So like you're kind of both
figuring out what you do next.

- That's true.

I'm a very good follow though.

- Okay.
- So I'm like,

I'm an invisible follow,

you do a move, it's like I-

- [Lex] Oh, interesting.

- I'm not like good at technique.

- I didn't know those existed.

Like a perfect-
- Oh, yeah, I've heard of it.

- So you could perfect-
- I really, I do.

I'm not great at technique
and sometimes I'll fall over,

but like with the following
part, I'm very good at it.

- Do you enjoy following?

- Yeah, yeah. It's really nice.

Again, like, it's the
very fast physical puzzle

you have to solve.

It's like typing, I really like typing.

That's why I was inquiring
about your keyboard earlier.

- Why do you like typing?

- Because it's like the very fast,

like a really rapid response.

What's it? The reaction time?

I like things that like have
very fast reaction times,

like games like that.

- But typing is not a reaction.

Or is it the brain generating
words and then you're like,

how's typing a reaction?

- Well, okay, the sensation
that I get when I am typing

is the kind of thing that
I'm trying to point at.

So maybe a reaction time isn't the quite,

I don't know what the term is,
but whatever that thing is.

Like, the thing where you
have to like look at a word

and then communicate it into your fingers.

- [Lex] Yeah.

- It feels like dancing.

- Like you're responding,
you're responding to your brain,

your fingers are doing the
responding to the brain

that generate the words.

- Yeah. Making your body do
what your brain wants it to do,

but like fast and precisely.

- Oh, then you might not
like this kineses keyboard

'cause it makes the, it
makes it easier to do that.

You probably like the struggle, right?

- No, well, I mean, that it
looks hard because you have,

it looks like it's high
depression on the keys.

- No, it's, well, oh, I see.

Yes. More than like a laptop keyboard,

but like that you don't have to,

one of the main things is

you don't have to move
your fingers at all.

So, like, for example,

a lot of people that I
think they have a backspace

up in the top right corner.

And so if you have to make
mistakes, which is like,

I mean that's like so metaphorical,

like every mistake you have
to like really hurt yourself

for it, 'cause you have to
like stretch for the backspace.

- There's that poetic narrative again.

- It's permeates-
- It like emanates

like a lot of

your perspective.
- Everything.

Yeah, no.

Yeah. And I see it as a good thing.

Like a romantic element
permeates my interpretation

of the world. Yes.

But you left home early.

How did you end up working at a factory?

- Well, I tried to go
to college, but failed.

Couldn't afford it.

- [Lex] Did you like it?

- I remember it just being really slow.

I remember being shocked that
the teachers didn't care.

Like I was used to homeschooling.

And, I don't know, like,
it just like it meant,

it felt like the people around
me that were teaching me,

'cause we had like a mom's group also,

like directly cared about
what I was learning,

and I would be able to ask questions,

and they would like really respond.

- [Lex] What's a mom's group?

- It was like homeschooling
groups who were a bunch of moms

who are homeschooling
their kids get together

and then teach each other's kids.

- Oh, cool.
- Yeah.

- And they have different, like,

interests and capabilities
and so on, and they kind of-

- And sometimes if some of the kids

are really good at something,

you have like the older kids
teaching the other ones too.

So it was very, like,
everybody kind of figures out

what they're good at, and
they share that skillset

with everybody else.

Which I think was a pretty great setup.

Honestly, I think my childhood

kind of sucked in a lot of ways,

but homeschooling was excellent for me.

Mainly because it just
had so much free time.

Like, I just did like two
to three hours of school

and then did whatever the fuck I wanted

for the rest of the day.

And I got to actually pursue
skills that are still useful

for me to this day.

- Even in that constrained environment?

- Hmm. Like, I wrote,

I've read fantasy books
and I wrote so much,

and now I'm writing a lot for my blog.

- What kind of fantasy books,

like sci-fi that type stuff?

- Like classic, like I
read like Mercedes Lackey

and the E.E. Knight and Ursula LeGuin.

- I don't know any of this. What is this?

What is it?

Is it a romantic thing or
is it like, is it romance?

- It's all the fantasy books,

like dragons and spells-
- Oh, dragons.

Got it, got it, got it, got it.

You didn't mention
Tolkien for the fantasy.

- I read Tolkien.

- Okay.
- Yeah.

- All right. Well, it is beautiful.

So you threw all the dragons,

how did you end up in a
factory? You try school?

- Yeah. Yeah.

I tried school, had drop
off a couple months,

and then I was like, "Well, I'm poor.

And I was ready to take any job,

I was like applying for sewer
jobs and then I got a factory,

I'm like, ah, 'cause my parents
no financial help at all.

They're like, "You pull yourself up

"by your own bootstraps," you know.

So anyway, I went to work at
a factory and that sucked ass.

Do not recommend it.

We wake up like 4:00 AM you know,

work on weekends too, fluorescent lights.

It was terrible.

And so I did that for about
a year and I was like,

this is, I was trying to
grit my teeth and be like,

"This is my life," right.

I didn't have high
expectations for my life.

I was just like,

I thought like if you get a
job where you don't have to be

on your feet all the time,
that you're living a good life.

But, and then I got another
job briefly as a photographer,

and then they fired me.

I think I was 19 at the time.

- Fired you for like what?
- I was just too young.

And really, really bad at
interacting with people

in the outside world.

Like, I was pretty well
socialized as a homeschooler

with other homeschoolers,
but in the outside world,

especially with all of the, like,

hierarchy submissions
stuff beaten into me,

like literally beaten into me,

it was very difficult for me
to interact with other people

who are like older than me

or had any sort of confidence at all.

So they hired me to do
like photography for people

and then I was rapidly turned
out that I was bad at this.

And so they fired me.

But at that point, I'd
left my factory job.

I'm like, "I can't go
back to the factory."

So I tried, I had some savings and I slept

on friends' couches and I tried

various self-employment stuff.

I'm like, "I mean, I can
do product photography

"or something."

But, it's Idaho, you know, nothing,

and if you're like a
19-year-old with no experience

in the outside world at all,
it was really difficult.

And so I had a friend recommend that I try

becoming a cam girl.

So that's how it started.

- What is camming?

What is being a cam
girl? What's that about?

- Camming is like, you
talk to the camera live

on the computer, like you live stream,

it's kind of like Twitch,

and then people are
typing in the chat like,

"Ha, do this stuff."

And then the people can tip you money,

and then you can do things in response.

Like, "Oh, if you tip
me 100 tokens, you know,

"I'll take my shirt off,"
or something like that.

- And like, what's the,
what site were you using

at that time?
- MyFreeCams.

- MyFreeCams?
- Yeah.

Is that a popular site?

- Yeah, it's pretty popular.
- Okay.

And how did, what were the next steps?

Like did you enjoy it?

- Oh, well it was the first
time I had actual control

over my life and I made, like,

actual real money and so
I just exploded into it.

I thought about it nonstop.

I was streaming all the time.

I was like coming up with
like new creative things.

And the thing is like, I don't know,

there's something about
public school that,

I ended up living in
a house with cam girls

full of other girls who
had gone to public school.

And I don't know if how much
of it's genetic or, like,

just because I'm weird or is
it because of our upbringing,

but I felt like I was much more fearless,

and much more weird and creative online

than other people were.

Not because they weren't awesome people,

but because I think like public school,

I got the impression based
on them talking about it,

that it sort of like beats out

any sort of deviance from you, like-

- More so than your, 'cause I got the-

- We had moral deviances
beaten out, but like,

you could do whatever-
- Creative deviance was not-

- Creative deviance wasn't so much, like,

I didn't have other kids
making fun of me ever.

I don't think I'd ever heard an insult

about my physical appearance
as a child or teenager once.

- So your father was basically saying

you're not good enough, was intellectual?

- Oh, that was like moral failing.

- Moral failings.
- Yeah.

Like, I was not virtuous,

sufficiently virtuous-
- Oh wow.

- Like in various ways.

Like, you know, like you're lazy,

mostly the lazy part (laughs).

I have like ADHD or something.

And I was not good at it as a kid either,

I would totally forget all the time.

- Is there some sexual
repression aspect to that?

Like, you know, how they say that there's,

it's not just homeschooling,

but just like Catholic girls
and so on, just because, like,

there's moral, you're
forbidden to do certain things.

Like there's a kind kind of
liberating feeling of saying

like, basically rediscovering yourself,

rediscovering your freedom
by doing just diving head in,

head first into sexuality,
into your own sexuality.

Is there some aspect of that?

- Yeah, absolutely, to some degree.

I think that like people kind
of model it slightly wrong.

Like, I think there's a truth to it.

But when I first got outta the house,

for me freedom was like
going outside at 2:00 AM

or like eating chocolate,
you know, on days

that I've previously wasn't
allowed to eat chocolate.

Like that was like a
really intense expression

of rebellion for me.

And I think people, like,
don't think of this,

like, I got out a lot of
my like intense rebellion

through things that people
don't typically consider

to be rebellious at all.
- Sure.

- Like I wore a bikini.
- Yeah.

- Insane.

- And just like walked
around in it, and like,

"I can do this."
- Yes. (chuckles) Basically.

And so, like, this was mostly

about emotional processing for me.

And took me a couple
years from leaving home

and all of that conservative
culture into doing sex work.

And in the meantime I was,

I did try having sex with a lot of people,

but this was mainly because I didn't know

what the norms were.

I didn't really understand.

I was just like, "Okay,
take things logically,

"take things one step at a time."

And I'm like, "Okay, if
the whole previous set

"about like how I'm not
supposed to kiss somebody

"until the altar of marriage,

"if that's not the way that
things are supposed to go,

"then what is the way
things are supposed to go?"

And I was like, "Well, if I am aroused,

"I should go have sex with someone, right.

"Is there any reason not to? No."

So I went and just,

I would go around asking random
people to have sex with me.

- Did you have any peer
pressure saying like,

"That's not good or that is good."

Or like any, did you feel
any currents of society,

in any direction?
- I think I did.

- Or you independently just thinking like

form first principles?

- I think, I mean like,

I'm not saying it was a
totally a clean thing.

I'm sure that I was
experiencing society telling me

this was bad.

But you have to know, like, I
wasn't watching normal movies

when I was a teen.

Like, we watched Christian movies.

The stuff that we watched was filtered.

Like I watched the
Titanic and I had no idea

that Jack and Rose had sex

because it was put through filtered-

- [Lex] Wait, did they?

- Yeah, they went and, you know,

he'd painted her naked and-
- Yeah. Yeah.

- There's was a scene in a car

on the ship.
- In the car?

Oh, on the ship.
- Yeah.

They had like cars in
storage and there's a hand.

I watched it again later and I was like,

"Oh, my God."
- I don't remember

the sex scene.

- Well maybe were you also put through

a filtered version?

- (laughs) Maybe it's the filter I see.

Like, did the couple in
the notebook also have sex?

'Cause maybe for romantic movies

I focus on the romance, maybe, right.

And the sex scenes are always
like weirdly filmed in these,

'cause it's never, I mean it doesn't,

it feels more like romance than sex.

I guess that's the main
focus of this, right?

- [Aella] Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.

- Yeah. Anyway, so they had sex.

That's good to know.
- They did,

I'm letting you know.

- [Lex] I'll go back and watch now

to fact check-
- You have your own personal

filter on your brain.

- And once you realize that there're some,

like the foundation of
your beliefs were wrong,

then everything might be wrong,

and you're kind of just
doing from first principles-

- Yeah, exactly from first
principles basically.

And again, like not totally
separate from culture.

But also I think in general,

I also have a predisposition
to just be like, you know,

fuck what culture tells you,

just figure out what's
right for you and do it.

And so that mixed with, you know,

the figuring things out
from first principles.

I did eventually figure out
that I didn't like having

casual sex with just
anybody quite as much.

So I stopped that.

But it took me a while to figure that out.

- What's the negative of casual sex?

- It's just, like, not good.

I mean, if you like
figure out the chemistry

you have with someone better
then it can be a lot nicer.

But I wasn't doing that.

I was just like, somebody
I met and I'm like,

"You seem kind of cute."

Okay. Like I didn't
bother to try and develop

just any chemistry.

I mean, I didn't know-
- Chemistry

even outside of sex, just chemistry,

like human chemistry-

- Yes, basic-
- Conversation.

- Yeah.
- Okay.

- I would, it's like kind of cringey,

but I would, like, walk up to guys

or send them messages, like,

"Would you like to have coitus?"

Is what I would say.

- [Lex] You would say coitus?

- I said that. (laughs)

- I mean it's kind of cute in a way.

- I mean, it's a girl
asking you to get laid,

so they probably didn't care that much.

(Lex laughs)

But anyway, I'm saying that, like,

I had a lot of rebelling out of my system

by the time I started sex work.

So, like, for me maybe,

I'm sure it was somehow related

'cause we were extremely
sexually repressed growing up.

I remember the day I
learned I had a vagina,

which was absolutely horrifying.

Do not recommend figuring
out you have another orifice

in your body, but, like-

- Do you wanna share the
process of you figuring out

that you had a vagina or is that?

- My sister told me I had a vagina.

- Oh. Like intellectually,
like there was somebody said.

You have a vagina.
- You have a vagina. Yeah.

- And that was horrifying to you?

- Yeah. I didn't know I had,

'cause you weren't
supposed to ever like touch

or look at yourself ever.

So I never did.

It was treated as really disgusting.

And so I had no idea
that what was going on

in my genital region.

And so one day my mom sat me down,

I think I was like 9 or
10, and she was like,

"You have a, (chuckles)
there's another opening."

- [Lex] What! (laughs)

- "And you're going to bleed out of it,"

is what she told me.

- "You're gonna bleed
out of it for a while."

And I was like, "What
the fuck mom?" (laughs)

I didn't know the word fuck was,

but I would've said that if I had known.

- When did you first learn the word fuck?

- Oh, I think I learned it
when I was at a playground

and it was written somewhere
and I read it out loud

and then a kid next to
me started giggling.

- Did you ever, did you say fuck again

for a while?
- No.

No. I think the next time was,

I swore the first time when I was 18,

like intentionally said a
swear word when I was 18.

- [Lex] Did it feel good?

- I was like really nervous,

it was like nerve-wracking.
- What's your favorite

swear word?

- I mean, fuck's pretty good.

- Yeah fuck's pretty good.

- [Aella] Yeah.

- Okay, so that's camming.

I mean, what are the
pros and cons of camming,

and how does OnlyFans map into this?

Did you switch to OnlyFans at some point?

- I did. Yeah.

I cammed for like five or six years,

and I burned out eventually.

- What are the good aspects,

what are the bad aspects of camming?

- Well, the good aspects were,
it was just your own terms,

you get to decide,

everything about it is under your control,

which I loved at the time.

I was like, "I can work
when I want, how I want,

"any sort of expression."

I experimented, and I
was a very successful,

I was making around $200 an hour,

which for that website at the
time was like pretty good.

I had elaborate routines, I was a mime.

I would do like, dress up as a mime

and then dress up a chair
and I would seduce the chair.

- Oh, cool.
- Yeah.

- Was there an artistic
element to it almost?

- Yeah. (chuckles) Very much.

I had like gnomes-
- Did you talk to the chair?

You had gnomes?

- No, I was a mime.

You don't-
- Oh, sorry. Right.

- Yeah. Get it straight, dude.

(both laughing)

- You know what I really
appreciate about you,

is I'm asking some really dumb questions

and you're answering it
in a very intelligent way.

So I appreciate that.

All right. Did you ask
the chair questions?

"I was a mime you fucking idiot."

Okay. I'm sorry.

It's true.

But there's gnomes on the-
- Yeah, gnomes.

- [Lex] Like big gnomes or small gnomes?

- Like lawn gnomes.

- [Lex] Lawn gnomes.

And you seduced the
lawn gnome on the chair,

the gnome is sitting on the chair?

- There were some, yeah,
gnomes on the chair.

I did a photo set,

which I submitted to Reddit
where I got abducted.

I was like stripping,
taking my clothes off,

and then slowly the gnomes
surrounded me in the background,

then dragged me off.

And I did this as a photo set and I-

- Consensually?

- I mean, I didn't feel
consensual in the photos, but...

- [Lex] Okay.

But it was the-
- Consensual

or not consent for the gnome?

- It was very successful
on Reddit, basically.

It was a top post on Gone Wild,

11th top post of all type on Reddit.

- Oh, on Reddit which I think
will probably just means

it's like it's artistic, it's interesting,

it's edgy, it funny,

so it's really, really well done.

- But it was really shocking
that nobody else was doing

anything creative with sex work.

Like for me it was like breathing,

like you're just doing
sex and you're bored,

I'm like, "What do you do?"

"Oh, let's try something funny."

Like it's just the natural progression.

And it felt to me like there
was almost no competition.

Like I would just be really
creative and like immediately

it was the top not safe
for work post on Reddit.

I'm like, "Well, I didn't
even try that hard."

And so it's really shocking
to me that that other women

who are doing this sort of thing.

- Is that still a little bit of the case?

Like that there's not
as much like, 'cause I,

from my sort of outsider perspective,

that seems to be still the case.

Like there's not, like,
as you describe it,

that's kind of cool.

That's like, almost like playing,

like having fun with sexuality almost.

- [Aella] Yeah.

- And yeah, but that does
require kind of thinking through,

it's almost like a creative project,

like a photography project
or something like that,

almost like a little skit movie.

It's interesting.

- It's this vibe of like,

how can you bring like vibrant novelty

to whatever you're doing,
anything you're doing.

And I really like doing
this with surveys too.

Like I've been doing a
lot of standard surveys,

but I'm also, like, experimenting

with novel, creative, artistic surveys.

I'm like, how do you
ask a question in a way

that's like beautiful and unusual,

and like a thing is
completely groundbreaking.

Like nobody's ever, like,

tried asking before-
- Always make everything

so poetic and romantic it's disgusting.

Now. (laughs)

But yes, I think you have
that engine in your head,

I guess, of creativity.

Like, yeah, the way you ask questions.

It's not trivial to do like for,

it's actually very difficult to do

like good survey questions.

And, I mean, we're joking, but like yeah,

almost like poetic because
you have to ask a question

in a way that doesn't lead to the answer.

- [Aella] Yes.

- Like you have to kind
of inspire them to think

and then indirectly get at the truth.

It's an art form, honestly.

- Yeah. And also in a way

where they don't misinterpret the question

because it's amazing how
any question you think,

oh this is the clearest question possible.

No, you're wrong, it
has to be even clearer.

- Right. Willingly or
unwillingly 'cause, like,

you also have to defend
against that question

being criticized later
when you publish about it.

All of that. You have to
think about all of that.

- I think this might be
my greatest strength.

So I'm not very good at statistics,

I'm not like a great at presenting data,

but I think probably my greatest strength

is, in fact, survey design,
and like a question phrasing.

'Cause I have created so
many thousands of polls,

and every single one I get
people telling me, like,

the way that they misinterpreted the poll.

So it's like-
- You've become a master-

- Gone through fire. (laughs)

And then, again, I'm testing
the phrasings all the time.

Like what happens if you
slightly shift phrasings?

And so I'll do the same
question test over time

to see how it changes
and the way the framing

affects the results.

- So the good and the bad of the camming.

She said good, what was it?

I forgot what you said-
- Your freedom.

- The freedom?
- Yeah.

- The freedom to be also be creative.

- Yeah, and that is
just, it was exhausting.

The site that I was on,

the way that it's structured
is that you're ranking

on the site and that's the
amount of people that see you,

that's the amount of money
you are on, you earn,

is affected by the amount
of money that you earn

on average over the last 60 days.

So if you're streaming
and nobody's tipping you,

this means that you're
going to be dropping down

in the rankings, which
is gonna make it harder

in the future.

- Oh, okay. So the rich
get richer on that site.

- Yeah. So it's very high pressure.

Like, if you're on, you
need to be making money

as fast as you can.

If you wanna continue to make money.

So that was really stressful.

It was very mentally taxing.

I would do it for a couple
hours and just log off

and be completely exhausted.

'cause you're just like
on as hard as you can.

And this is why I have a
little PTSD around streaming,

like I've considered Twitch streaming

I tried a little bit and I'm like,

I haven't fully integrated the fact

that you don't have to be
like maximally entertaining

every single second yet.

You can actually just
chill out and take it slow

and nothing bad happens.

- Yeah, yeah. You can just enjoy silence.

- [Aella] Yeah.

- Did you feel lonely doing it?

I mean even just streamers feel lonely.

- I moved into a house with cam girls.

- [Lex] Did that make it better or worse?

- Better. They're great.

I'm still friends with them to this day.

- Oh, so it was like a team,

almost like "We're in
this kind of together?"

- Yeah.

So we'd, like, work
together and, you know,

stream together and swap
our clothes and stuff.

It was great.

- Swap ideas too?
- Swap ideas. Yeah.

- And actually on a small
tangent, maybe a big tangent,

what do you think, 'cause
it's the recent controversy

of Andrew Tate and that he,

I think in the past
ran a camming business,

and he's being accused of sex trafficking.

What do you think,

like from your own experience,

what do you understand about Andrew Tate?

Is he a good person, is he a bad person?

Is there something shady
about his practices or not?

- I wish I could answer, but I don't know.

I haven't looked into it at all.

- At all?
- I've heard

people talking about it,

I just haven't bothered to go into it.

It is well known that,

like, when I was doing it back in the day,

that Eastern European models

had something different going on though.

It was like a trope about, you know,

there's the Eastern European models

and then there's everybody else.

- That they're what?

It's like darker or something like that?

- Like they do studios and
they're a lower quality.

- Which means what?

- Studios are,

you go into like a warehouse
and then they have set up

a little like things
that replicate bedrooms,

but they're just like stalls.

And then you give, you rent out

or you pay the studio
percentage of your income.

And you can tell when
something looks like a studio.

It's like a type of background.

That if you like watching
enough, it kind of starts to,

you notice the patterns.

- So like the standards are lower there

and the ethical boundaries
are a little looser?

- Yes.
- How people are treated.

- I never heard anything
about the ethical,

I just knew that it
was like lower quality.

Like the girls seem like
they were less into it,

and like cared less.

- How does this all interplay
with like sex trafficking?

So consensual versus non consensual.

- I would be shocked
if there were never any

non-consensual camming.

I mean, I guess is like if
it were going to happen,

that wouldn't be surprised
if it were, in fact,

Eastern European models.

Based on, this is
outdated, I'm just thinking

of my stereotypes back
when I cammed a lot.

- Sure. So some of that is stereotypes

versus like collecting good data, right?

- Yeah. I haven't done data on cam girl.

- It's hard, I mean it's hard.

it's even hard to get that data, right.

But obviously a really important problem.

- There's a method that I'm
trying that I really like.

I designed a survey type,

which is like asking people who you know.

Like who do you know who's done this?

And you tell me like,

"Oh, do you know anybody who's a doctor?

"Do you know anybody who
you know has had cancer?

"Or like smokes or-"

- [Lex] Personally you mean?

- Yeah, personally.

Just, do you know anybody?

And then if you ask about
a whole bunch of things,

you can calibrate the responses.

- That's really interesting.
- SO like, if your population,

you know, 20% of them know doctors

and then you know the
actual amount of doctors,

then you can tell like
how this is corresponding.

Like, what is the visibility of doctors?

- So you can reconstruct the graph-

- Basically. Yeah.

And we can do this with sex trafficking.

And, of course, people are gonna be like,

"Well sex trafficking is not visible.

"People, you don't know those."

I'm like, "Well then we can ask about

"other non-visible things
that other people don't know

"that we do have data for>"

Like homelessness or
being in jail or like,

if you have been like sexually assaulted,

a lot of people don't like talking about

if they've been sexually assaulted.

So you know a whole bunch
of things that are like

similarly suppressed in
knowledge in some way

that we do actually have rates for.

And then compare that to the
graph when we ask people,

do you know anybody who's in sex traffic?

So again, this is not perfect,

I'm not saying this is ideal-

- But you can infer things,

you can infer things about that graph.

- But then say we don't
have good ways of measuring

sex trafficking right now.

Anyway, I did a big deep
dive in on the research

that we have on sex trafficking
in the Western world

and the actual, like, I read
the studies and like reports

about the studies and it's really pitiful.

We have terrible data.

It's like, there's just
like vague estimations

made from one guy in a
basement in the '80s.

That's like the basis
for like one big study

that, like, a lot of people report on.

And so I'm like, okay, so
the method I'm proposing,

obviously it's not perfect,

but like the bar is so low at this point.

- Well I wonder also if
there's ways to design

a survey that gets at the
victims of sex trafficking also,

which is, they presumably
have public access

to the internet.

And I wonder how many of
them are distinctly aware

that they're victims.

Like it's asking the question,

when you're inside of
a toxic relationship,

are you inside of a toxic re relationship?

I mean, if the toxic
relationship is truly toxic,

sometimes your mind is fucked with, right,

you don't even know what's true.

And so it's interesting if
you can design surveys that-

- [Aella] That are
actively sex trafficked?

- Yeah. Who break through that.

So basically get data on how many people

are getting sex trafficked directly.

- Oh yeah. Like, if you don't frame it,

like, if you don't say
the word sex trafficking.

If you're like, are you just
in a situation where you'd...

- And maybe through the survey,
I mean that's very meta,

but through the survey help them.

- You know, I did this,

this is what started my
relationship surveys.

So I've done a series
of relationship surveys,

and that was because I knew somebody

in a terrible relationship
and I was, like,

"I bet if she took a survey
where she answered questions

"about her relationship
and at the end got a score

"that compared her to everybody else,

"she'd be like, 'Oh
wait, everybody else has

"much better relationships than I do.'"

So that's why I started making
the relationship surveys,

was exactly for that reason.

- Yeah. That's really,
really, really powerful

to know that like you're
not crazy for thinking

this is a bad relationship.

- Right. Or I think like the
actual question is, like,

"Could you do better if you broke up?"

I think that the thing
that keeps most people

in their relationships is like,

"This is the best that I can do.

"And like, this is normal."

And if it were normal, I
would say that they are right.

Like, if you live in a
culture where everybody

is abusing their people in
their relationships, then yeah,

I mean, what are you gonna do,

break up and then just be alone
for the rest of your life?

Most people don't wanna do that.

- But now comparing
yourself to the average

is good to know, to know.
- Yeah.

Know your options are.

- At least understand
it because, you know,

being normal is not always, like,

this conversation is not always great.

Meaning this conversation
is anything but normal.

Okay. And (sighs) that
was a tangent on a tangent

about a niche passion,

which is really fascinating
that you're playing

with those kinds of
ideas of survey design.

But back to camming.
So what were the cons?

What were the negatives of camming?

- Oh, like the exhaustion
of just like live,

like the high pressure thing,

that was probably the worst thing.

- So was there, what about the interaction

with different people?

Like the dynamics of the interaction

with the fans, I guess.

- I had a pretty great time.

I mean it obviously it wasn't perfect

'cause it's the internet,
but I don't know.

This is a thing that confuses me a lot

because a lot of women
that I know complain

about being harassed by men quite a lot,

they're like, you know, "Men are always,

"you know, groping our ass.

"You know, you have to
be paranoid in the club.

"People are, like, they're
always huffing on you

"and you're just like, 'Jesus
Christ, get away, man."

And I do not have this experience.

Or like, maybe I do, but I'm
interpreting it differently.

I don't know.

But the thing is, I
don't know what causes me

to have such a different
experience from these women

that are like really, feel
really hostile towards men.

And my guess is that
there's some sort of, like,

very subtle signaling that
we're accidentally doing,

through, like, no fault of our own.

I'm not saying this is a virtue,

I'm saying like maybe it's just genetic,

or fact that I'm tall.
- That women are doing?

- Yeah. That the women are doing.

- Yeah.
- Okay.

- And it might be just
something I'm completely

accidentally, through no intention,

like having to signal the
thing that is causing men

to not view me as like a desirable target

or like a target at all.

- But what about the flip side?

Maybe you're not sensitive
to the creepy stare.

- Yeah. That also might be true.

- The dude who's like is
undressing you with his eyes,

that, like, in a creepy
way, that you're just not,

you don't like worry about it.

Or you're not touched
like, the fear of that,

the anxiety of that, the
unpleasantness of that

just doesn't hit you.

- I think that's also at least part of it,

maybe all of it.
- Yeah.

- Yeah. I think there's
some evidence for it.

I think often like guys
will do a thing to me

and I'm just like, "That's a thing, cool."

I don't have any negative
response whatsoever.

- That's call back to
the tire. It's a thing.

"This is nice, that happened.

"It was good to know that can happen."

- Like, I once had like a
homeless guy like ask me

to "Come back to my place baby."

And I was like, "This is fun."

Like, I'm like, "Do you want me to,"

I love asking men, like,

"Are you trying to get
me to have sex with you?"

Just like saying it out front.

And they'll be like, "Well,"
usually they stop for a minute,

like, "Well, yeah, I mean
I would like to have sex."

And I'll be like, "Thanks for asking,

"but I'm not interested
in having sex with you."

"Hope you have a good day?"

And then I walk away.

(both laughing)

And that's great. I don't know,

I have no issues with that interaction.

But like maybe this is the
kind of thing that other women

would find to be really offensive.

- So you have that conversation

and it doesn't turn into
like a threatening feel?

- No.
- Like with a homeless guy?

- No. I've never had that happen though.

But I think there's just something,

I think I'm doing something like, again,

this is kind of accidental.

Like, I'm just am like this always,

and I think I just happen
to be like this at people

and they don't expect it.

Like, they don't expect
me to be like really nice

while explicitly asking them
what their intentions are.

Like directly putting my
finger on the thing that like,

"Oh, you're trying to have sex with me."

And then also not judging them for it.

I think this like throws
people off a little bit

so they don't get aggressive.

They're like, "Oh, you're
autistic or something."

- Even the cloak of
anonymity on the internet

you weren't getting the toxicity.

- Yeah, I just think I'm just not reactive

and, or maybe I'm giving
off, I don't know.

I don't know what's going
on, maybe it's both,

maybe it's a feedback loop.

So I had a pretty good experience.

I know not everybody did,

definitely people reported
having antagonistic experiences,

but when I was camming I
generally really liked,

people were really nice
to me, had a great time,

made friends.

- So you also did
OnlyFans, as you mentioned,

and I read on a website,

so this is very investigative reporting,

that on some months you have made

over $100,00 dollars on OnlyFans.

How did that feel?

- Great. Really great. (laughs)

- I mean like, well, actually,

because so much of your upbringing

you didn't have money, you had to struggle

with the factory job and so on,

maybe a good person to ask.

Can money buy happiness?

- Well, I mean, I think
like a resting set point

of happiness regardless of
how much money you have.

But money can buy being
less stressed, I would say.

- Is there a lot of variation

in the basic rest happiness
for humans, in general?

Like is that a good thing to think about?

- I mean, they've done
some studies, but again,

like, again, I'm not sure,

I haven't actually read the study,

so maybe they didn't
replicate where, like,

they measured people
before and after winning

a bunch of money to see if
their happiness was higher.

I think, like, it's by
some measures it wasn't,

by some it wasn't.

- No. I mean like basically
almost genetically,

so nature-nurture.

But is there, let's say after you're 18,

is there like some
stable level of happiness

that all the environmental
genetic factors combine

to create so that everything
that life throws at you

has to face that happiness?

I think you mentioned earlier
that I seem to be happy

with a lot of stuff, so
maybe I have a certain level.

Do other people have a lower level,

some people have higher level?

- [Aella] Yeah, definitely.

- Like, is that a useful,

or is that a useful model of human beings,

or is it all ups and downs?

Like is it all like

there's no staple.
- I think like combo, right.

I don't know, some people just are happier

than others in general,
and other people aren't.

But then you also have ups and downs.

Like, I'm sure you've
experienced sadness sometimes

and happiness the other times.

- Like if I actually were to integrate,

so have an integral under
the, area onto the curve,

I don't know if I'm
different than other people.

Maybe I'm just like really
focused on the happy moments,

and maybe feel the down
moments most intensely.

And maybe that like on
average is just all the same.

Is that possible?

- I mean. Maybe.

I just, I don't know.

Like, I remember when I was a kid,

my mom would call me
Pollyanna all the time.

'Cause I was like finding
the good and everything.

- [Lex] Oh, yeah?

I'll be like, something bad would happen-

- [Lex] So you were happy kid?

- I was a really happy kid, yeah.

- Even in the harsh condition.

- Yeah. I mean, like I said,

like I said even the harshness
comes from the bad meaning,

like, and I had good a
meaning applied to it.

- [Lex] You were stoic?

- I was, yeah. (chuckles)

- With another book I'm reading next week,

tune in Marcus Aurelius
"Meditations", (chuckles).

(Aella laughing)

All right. All right.

Camming. 100k.

So it felt good.

So it's crazy though, right,

you can just like take
clothes off in a creative way

with some gnomes and make 100,000.

- Yeah. I mean there was a
lot more to it than that,

but yeah.

- What was it?

What's the process?
- I mean, it's marketing.

Like, so with only, with MyFreeCams,

I was unusual in that I decided to do

outside of the website marketing.

I would like post on Reddit, right,

this was very unusual at the time.

But, like, OnlyFans is
structured such that

they have almost no internal
discovery whatsoever.

So if you want people
to come to your page,

you have to go to go out
onto external websites

and advertise for yourself directly.

Very different model.

And so this is something
I had already been doing

and already had practice in.

And so I think I was like
already quite advanced.

Like, I already had an account
on Reddit that was, like,

seven years old at the time.

Tons of, like, karma,

that means I could post in subreddits.

I had already been on
Twitter for years, you know,

like posting actively.

So I already had like presence
on all these other platforms

that really helped with the conversion.

- [Lex] Reddit and Twitter.

- Reddit, Twitter,
Feltlife, Instagram, TikTok.

- And you were still
advertising creatively?

- Yeah.
- So like there's sexuality,

but there's also like creative
sexuality, and ideas too.

- Yeah. Like one of the
really popular ones was,

I, like, molested myself as a mime using

a one arm through a jacket.

And so the jacket looked like it was,

(both laughing)

- That's how it is.
- The jacket looked like

it was alive and, you know,

and that one did really well.

- Did you like brainstorm
with somebody and, like,

I recently got to hang out with MrBeast

and sit on a session of
brainstorming different ideas,

I just envisioned you with
like a team brainstorming.

"How about we try the mime
and the molesting thing?"

"I don't know. It's too edgy."

- (laughs) I wish,

I think the team would've
been a lot more fun.

But, no it's just me.

Like, I had an apartment
to look like, kind of,

like this, you know, you
just sit alone, you're like,

"Well that would be a good idea."

And I'd seen, you just collect
ideas over time, right.

Like, I'd seen somebody
doing a version of,

like this animated hand
act like when I was a kid,

and it just always stuck in my head.

And like one day I was like,
"I bet I could do that."

And then when I was trying
to think of ideas to do

as a sex worker, I was like,
"Why don't I just try that?"

And then it turned out to be like really

like quite a viral hit.

- Is there stuff, like
you mentioned, too edgy,

like MrBeast tries to keep it PG?

Do you try to keep it PG13?

- Well, with the sex
advertising stuff, (chuckles)

I mean it's sex advertising,

so it's obviously not PG13.

- I don't know these ratings.

What is beyond that?
- It's not

family friendly. It is X.

Like the one that I'm
describing to you at some point,

like you can see my boob.

- There's a boob is X.

- A boob is I guess

maybe R.
- I thought R.

I think you could show a boob in PG13.

- Maybe X is like if you got some sort of

rhythmic motion going on.

- Maybe that sound,

but the rhythmic motion not.
- With the sound.

- You can have one or the
other but you can't have both.

(both laughing)

You have both then it's X.
- That's where we hit

the X. Yeah.
- Okay.

- So you definitely not,

I mean with the sex advertising stuff,

like guys like vanilla shit,
guys want basic hot girl,

you can do something like
kind of sexy and creative,

like getting abducted by gnomes,

or like the self molestation, right,

but those are still pretty
within the normal boundaries.

- What do you mean guys
like vanilla stuff?

- [Aella] Mean most
guys like vanilla stuff.

- What's vanilla stuff?

- Like hot booby parts.
- See we talk

about fetish, fetishes?

I think my Overton window on
what is vanilla is expanding

(laughs) quickly after
following your work.

But yeah, what is that?
- I actually have done

a lot of studies on what is vanilla?

Like I've done a couple different
surveys where I ask people

like how taboo is this thing?

And I have a like a rating
from least to most taboo.

- By the way, I don't like,

I don't appreciate the
beauty of vanilla ice cream.

- You don't?
- No.

- It is really good though.

- You eat vanilla ice cream?

- [Aella] I eat vanilla ice cream. Yeah.

- I think there's just
so many more options,

it's like the absence of creativity.

- I mean, if you put in

like some chocolate chips or something.

- Yeah. You already made it
more interesting to start.

Okay, so what's vanilla?

And why do guys like vanilla?

So hot girl doing hot girl things.

What, like undressing

and then having sex?
- Yeah.

The thing that I found was most successful

were frames where the
man was framed as passive

and the woman is active.

Or like, for example, like,

"Oh, you know, we got
assigned to the same bunk

"at the breeding school or something."

Or like, "Oh we're the last
people on Earth," right.

Or like, "Oh no, you know,
I desperately need somebody

"to like cure me with this
disease and I need semen."

So it's like in any
scenario where the guys

just like finds himself
such that the woman

like desperately needs
him for some reason,

he doesn't have to do much.

That is like typically
one of the much more

successful things.

Like guys like women
falling into their lap.

- What about the power dynamic?

- So guys are less into power
dynamics than women are.

And you can do power dynamics

as long as it's like handed to them.

Some guys, obviously, some
guys are like very dominant

and like prefer like having to work,

but this is the minority.

Like if you're trying
to do, make 100K a month

and you're trying to appeal
to the widest group of people,

the most effective advertising,

you're not gonna be making the most money

by being like particularly submissive.

- So on the camming side that's,

you're unlike escorting or
just personal relationships,

you're trying to, you have an audience,

you have like a theater full of people.

- [Aella] Like with live camming.

- Yeah, with live camming.

- [Aella] Yeah. It's like a live theater.

- Does that freak you out,

there's just a bunch of people watching?

- I mean, what, how do you feel right now?

- I don't know they're,
'cause it's not live.

- Yeah, that's true, it's not live.

- So they're not watching.
- Like it might as well be,

like they could be watching.

- I feel like there's just
the two of us, I don't know.

And there's like,

sometimes I imagine
there's a third person-

- Like God?

- Usually. No, no, not, not God.

Just, I usually imagine either
a guy or girl or a couple

just sitting there for some reason.

Like, usually on the
beach and usually high,

or on some kind of like a mushroom,

just like listening passively,

just kind of looking at the sunset,

that's what I imagine.

- Oh, that's really good.

I think that's useful, like,
when I write my blog posts

sometimes I do terribly,

but it's the most effective when I imagine

one person that I'm writing
to, to try to explain.

And like having a high
couple watching the sunset

is maybe really lovely as a calibration.

- I have to say it is pretty romantic

'cause I've gotten a
chance to meet couples

that listen to podcasts together.

I don't know why that seems
like intensely romantic to me

because, like, 'cause you're
not watching TV together,

you're listening to a thing,

and I guess sometimes they watch it,

but like you're listening
to ideas together.

I don't know, seems-

- It's like you're going through

the same kind of thought process

at the same time.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

That's a really beautiful way to put it.

So it's like you're
melding, you're thinking

is following the same line,

somehow podcasts do that more than movies.

I think movies give you a lot more freedom

to think about stuff.

I feel like your thoughts
are aligned and, like,

especially if the podcast is good,

like if it's listening to
like a Dan Carlin podcast like

about history, that you're
like on a journey together.

There's an intimacy to that. Anyway.

But I've learned that couples do that,

you know, hashtag relationship goals.

Go ahead.

- That's what you want
with your feature wife?

- With my, yeah-

- You should make an application.

- [Lex] Application?

- An application for dating you.

I mean, maybe this is
more of like my strategy

and less yours, but you have
like a wide enough audience

that might work.

- (chuckles) It's not,

okay, let's just go there.

'Cause you put together
an application of, like,

people to have casual
sex with you, I think.

You've had-
- That and also dating. Yeah.

- And also dating in a relationship.

I'd love to, so what
is in that application?

Because like, you know,

I'm sure there's a quite a lot of people

that would like to date
you or to sleep with you,

but finding the person.

I mean it depends what your goals,

I guess relationship would be
an open relationship for you?

- Yes.
- Right.

Like for me, I guess, it's
more intensely selective

because it's like a
monogamous relationship

and a committed one.

Like, I'm swinging for like long term.

I'm not like weirdly
obsessed with long term,

but it's like you just,

I would love to have one
girl for the rest of my life,

but finding that I feel like applications

will not get to that

I feel like there's
some aspect of the magic

of the serendipity of it,

of meeting people in
strange places and so on.

I just personally have
noticed that like fame

has not made that process easier.

- But I mean, like if you could, you know,

if there's two rooms and one of them

is like random population of hot women

and the other one is random
population of hot women,

but all of them definitely are monogamous

and are looking for a long-term
committed relationship.

Like which room would you rather go into?

Like if you're looking for a mate?

- Yeah, well, but see
I guess my preferences

are more, that's it's
a really strong point,

but my preferences are represent

the majority probably, right?

'Cause don't most women want
monogamous relationships?

- [Aella] Yeah.

So like, I'm okay with either option

'cause, like, statistically speaking-

- But, like, we can apply it

to like a bunch of other things.

Yeah. And I'm just.
- Be more specific.

- This is just a problem
if you have like high,

if you have a high
volume to filter through

and you, like, you don't know.

Like it's a good like initial filter.

Like you can take it
from like 1,000 people

to 20 people and then
go on dates with them.

- Oh, but the filter is so anti-romantic.

Like what?
- (laughs) This is true.

This is not the romantic narrative

that you're very prone to.

- If I feel like, "How did you two meet?"

"Well, she passed the
three filters I set up."

And I mean, but that's also,

but also can you put
into a survey the things

that you're interested in?

- [Aella] Yes.

- I mean I definitely
think about this a lot

with hiring, like teams,
engineers and so on.

But with engineers

you're okay losing truly special engineers

because you have to filter

'cause there's like
thousands of applications.

Like it feels like, (sighs)

it feels like I worry that you would miss

the thing that actually, 'cause so much

of it is chemistry.
- Yeah, you're right.

- So much of it is like
the magic, you know.

- The thing is you're
missing it anyway, like-

- Yeah, you're missing it just-

- Or you can just run
it and then in addition

try some of those people,
but then go on the dates

that you were going to go
on with anyway, regardless,

it's just the thing that
helps like pull someone

out of the crowd.

- Because, I dated a guy from my survey.

I'd ran the survey. I
assigned point values

to each of the questions.

And went on a date with
like the top couple people,

and then one of them I was like,

and I'm still dating him to
this day, it was awesome.

And I would never,

I never would've gone on a date
with him without the survey.

- Can you, if from memory
or we can look it up.

Do you remember what kind of
questions were on the survey?

- I asked a couple different categories.

I asked about like basic life stuff.

So like what kind of relationships?

Like monogamy versus polyamory.

Like, do you want kids?

Like, where you wanna live?

Like basic things that
you need to be compatible.

And then I asked like
sexual compatibility,

like various preferences.

And then I had a section
about like personality,

like what are, I tried to ask questions

that would do the most
effective filtering.

So like what are ways
that like I can't give

people what they need that
like maybe they really want.

Like I don't really,
I'm not very outdoorsy.

Which is very common.

A lot of people like being outdoorsy.

So I asked the question like
how much do you value someone

else that you're dating being outdoorsy?

If they marked yes, I was
like, okay we probably,

I should write downgrade

for the results.
- But what if, man,

but doesn't polyamory
make that really difficult

'cause can't they find somebody

for the outdoorsy stuff?
- Yeah, they could.

I mean this doesn't like,

but if you're going to have somebody,

it's like nicer to have them
be more compatible than less.

- But you're a little bit like in terms of

sexual compatibility,
you were able to, like,

you're self-aware enough to
know what preferences you have,

like you can?

- I think so.

I think that one helped
a lot with the escorting.

Like, the escorting helped a lot

with knowing my preferences.

- But there's like out
of the the giant pool

of different preferences,

you have like a subset that's
clearly defined for you?

Okay. Like dominant submissive-

- [Aella] Yeah. Power dynamic stuff.

- Power dynamic stuff.
- For that.

- Okay. In the not just sexual
but in relationship too,

like, was that in a survey?

- I don't like power
dynamics in relationships.

I didn't have-
- Not defining them in

like making it clear in a survey,

like, asking a question
about power dynamics

in a relationship.

- I don't think I asked
about power dynamics

in relationships.

'Cause I just assume most people don't.

And there's a lot of
things that kind of like-

- Most people don't.

You're putting together a survey,

a systematic survey to
understand compatibility.

Wouldn't power dynamics
inside of relationships

that naturally emerge often
be part of the question?

Or is that hard to question

because it naturally emerges
and you can't really-

- Well, the thing is
like a lot of questions

sort of overlap in demographic,

and if you're making a survey,

you wanna have the
minimum possible questions

that give the maximum possible
like filtering information.

- Yes, yes, yes.

Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

But that purpose of
that survey wasn't to do

a good research study, it
was to select one subject

that you could take.

- So that part of it is good.

Like you want to most
efficiently filter out

because one, like you get
more people taking the survey,

the fewer questions you have,

which is good for finding a mate.

Like if you have 5,000
men take the survey,

it's better than 1.000 men taking it.

- Don't you want men that
would be patient enough

and dedicated enough to fill out?

- Yeah, like what if you're
like a high-powered man

who's like on his lunch break, right?

So it's like you just-

- It's like a billionaire's too busy

just flipping through.
- Exactly.

- Yeah.

- And the guy that I date
was, he took the survey,

he was waiting for the pizza
to come out of the oven.

And so it was important that it was short.

And so you wanted me-
- Is it a metaphor

or literally pizza coming out the oven.

- He's literally waiting for
pizza and he saw the thing,

he's like, "I guess I'll just fill out

"this survey really fast."
- Wow.

- Changed our lives.
- So romantic.

- It's for me, this is my kind of romance.

I'm really into it.

But, you could be efficient with surveys

by like making sure your
questions don't overlap.

So for example, if
somebody's very polyamorous,

they're very unlikely to be interested

in like a traditional
like man works in like,

in-out and the job, and
the woman's stays home

and raises the kids' kind of relationship.

Because poly people just
generally don't do that.

And so if I'm asking about polyamory,

it's sort of kind of
already covers the thing.

And so if I have a whole
bunch of questions,

like I can kind of like
triangulate a bunch of implicit

kinds of questions that I
haven't directly asked about.

So this is why I didn't ask
directly about power dynamics

because, like, from the
rest of the questions

that are in my survey, like, I
can pretty accurately predict

whether or not you're gonna be
interested in power dynamics.

- See, but I'm afraid, yeah,
like I'm trying to think

as you're talking, I get it.

That's really interesting
that you did that.

Also, maybe not for the
effectiveness of finding a partner,

but for just exploring
the actual, the process

of human sexuality, of like the search,

this complicated optimization process

we're all engaging in on
the landscape of happiness.

That seems to be this,

not even a differentiatable function,

it's a giant non-linear mess.

Okay. But like for me,

I don't think I would be
able to design that survey.

I would like bias it too strongly.

Like, I would probably
prefer women that have read

Dostoevsky or something like that.

Like that'll be a filter for me, right.

But like, that's a horrible filter

'cause there's a lot of, like,

there's a lot of amazing
people that have never,

they don't give a shit about reading,

or they don't give a shit about
reading Russian literature,

or they don't give a shit about,

but they're amazing and
passionate and creative

in some other dimension

that you might completely miss.

But you're like, 'cause
I wonder if there's any,

basically you're saying
compatibility like hard lines

that you know statistically
is just going to be an issue.

- Yeah. You mean you
weight, there's a lot more?

- Yeah.
- But there's also

like preferences.

Like if you have a woman
who's totally equal

and she's read the thing that you like,

choose another woman who's also identical,

but like she hasn't read
the thing that you like,

like you probably very slightly prefer

the one that has.
- But you don't know

if they're identical.

Yes. Yes. But like you
can't through survey

get the identical.

Like you don't know-

- Sure. But you can kind of like do

a whole bunch of weights.

So like the person that,

like, I ended up going on a date with,

he did not answer like correctly

to a lot of the survey questions,

but he didn't have, he was just, overall,

overall the weights were like,

he just tended to be
more in the direction.

- Was there a text-based
fill-in like survey,

but, like, sorry, paragraph, like-

- No, you ought to avoid
that if you're dealing

with like large amounts of data. (laughs)

- No. Why not?

'Cause you have to fill...

Oh, oh, interesting.

Interesting. Like, I'm different.

'Cause, like, first of all,
you can do keyword searches.

- No. Okay, that's fair.
- And second,

all you do, you can do machine
learning models that like,

first of all you can
do like crude metrics,

like the length-
- That's a good point.

- Of how long they've written, right.

And it could flag certain things.

Yeah. It's actually pretty easy to

like I've looked at like for hiring,

I've looked at like
thousands of applications

really quickly.
- Really?

- You can really, the human
brain is really interesting,

especially, like, if
you visually highlight

certain information for
yourself, like keywords or again,

with machine learning
models like sentiment,

you can highlight different
parts that will catch your eye

better than not,

and I can go through just a
huge number of applications.

- Are you telling me I can use,
if I learn machine learning,

I can process dating
survey applications better?

- Yes. No, like textual.

- Yeah. Like I can like have
them write things in, like,

this is like a new way of...

- That would be, yeah-
- It's a really

good incentive.

- I think that would,

so it's a really nice
aspect of text input,

like long-form text input,

multiple long-form text input based

on an interestingly phrased question

is you get to learn how
to make a better survey.

I think you would appreciate that.

Like you start to see how
they're actually interacting

with these questions.

Like I asked certain questions, like,

just to see how people think.

Is it better to work smart
or better to work hard?

Or is it ever okay to
betray a close friend?

Like, I'll ask like questions like this

that don't really have a right answer,

but I just wanna see how they think.

Or is truth more important than loyalty?

And I get their long-form answer.

- You get, like, and you get to see

their reasoning presses of with it.

- Yeah, yeah.

Like what they, it reveals so much,

not just about the person,

but about the kind of
questions I should be asking,

that has nothing to do
with truth or loyalty,

but like how to get a good engineer

with like very specific questions.

But I think it's really
useful to get text input.

- I have done text input
usually with beta surveys.

So I usually do beta surveys
before I do the real survey.

- [Lex] What's the beta survey?

- Like I do like a shorter version,

or it depends on what I'm doing,

but like a different version of the survey

that I have people take before I release.

I use the information
from the initial survey

to inform the questions that
I ask in the real survey.

And I haven't actually in recently,

but I used to do a lot of
like the text-based questions

to see for similar.

Although I don't think I relied
it on it quite as heavily,

and if I introduced machine learning,

I think it'd be a lot more efficient.

- I love that you're also doing, like,

you're writing scripts and
stuff, like you're doing,

you're doing some, like,
statistical analysis.

Are you using Python also?

- Yeah but, yeah.

I had to learn Python for this

just a couple of months ago.
- Which is the best

way to learn Python.

And the best reason to
learn machine learning

is to solve actual, like, problems.

- Yeah. I can't be motivated.

I'm just not motivated
to learn something unless

there's an actual curiosity I have,

and I have to learn it and to solve it.

I was trying to avoid
learning coding for so long,

but eventually it was, my
data set became too large.

I couldn't work with anything else.

Oh, Python, it is.

- You know what's also
an interesting data set

that you're probably
interested in a little bit

is like Twitter itself, right.

I dunno if you've, I've played
with the Twitter API a lot.

- Can you just get the
download the, I'm just,

I'm stuttering now because.

- Download the Twitter?

Can you download Twitter?

(both laughing)

No. There's a lot of Twitter.

So Twitter's a social network
with a bunch of people,

they're interacting a lot.

Like, there's, I don't know,

the number's insane, the
number of interactions,

but there's different ways to interact

to get data from Twitter.

There's streams you can look at,

depends on what you're interested in.

You can do results for searches.

You can look at individual
tweets and get entire,

which to me is super interesting.

The entire tree of different
conversations, the replies.

- [Aella] Ooh.

- Which might be very interesting for you

because, like, it's not,

it's much harder to ask rigorous questions

which you do with your polls,

but you could see like how
divisive certain things are

with like a sentiment-
- You probably could like

calibrators to figure out
like exactly what questions

you should be asking.

- Yeah. And also highlight
interesting anecdotal things

when like two people
freak out at each other

and just argue, like a thread that goes on

for like 1,000 messages,

that you might never be
even aware is happening

'cause you're like,

'cause Twitter doesn't like surface that.

Like, it would be Twitter
doesn't make it easy for you

to like visualize what the hell's going on

even with your own social network.

Like, if you post something
that's controversial

that gets a large amount of attention,

you can't clearly visualize
everything that's going on.

Like, it's very, it's a blurry, amorphous,

like you're just kind of
looking through the fog

at different replies and then kind of...

Yeah. So to be able-
- Through the API,

they have like graphs and of networks?

- No, the data for the graphs, yeah.

So you can reconstruct

yourself, yeah.
- Oh, that's so cool.

- And then you have
different levels of access

in terms of how many queries you can do.

- That is really cool.

And now because there's like Elon,

there's a lot of sort
of revolutionary stuff

happening at Twitter.

I think you could literally, sort of,

push for innovation there.

Like there's aggressive
innovation happening.

So in terms of requesting
stuff for the API,

you could do all that kind of stuff.

I think Twitter's just a
fascinating platform for the,

as cliche as it sounds, for studying.

For me it's interesting,

what makes for a healthy conversation.

That term has been used,

but it's interesting how
conversation to me is fascinating,

how conversations break down and not.

Like how, like the virality of drama

or conflict or disagreement,

how that evolves when a large
number of people are involved.

When a large number of
misinterpretation of statements

is involved in text base with
some anonymity thrown in.

Like, I feel like there's a lot of studies

that can be done there.

- I mean, Twitter's probably
not great at it, right,

as it stands.

- [Lex] No.

- 'Caus it's like necessarily short,

you can quote things out
of context, et cetera.

- But we should understand that, right.

At a scale, at a large
scale you should be able to

study that kind of thing.

What were we, oh yeah, what
was your casual sex survey?

- I actually haven't
looked at it in a while.

I think I just asked people

about a whole bunch of fetishists.

'cause you don't wanna
be obvious about yours

because then people are gonna
hijack it to try to tell you

that they like what you like,
so you wanna be obscure.

So how do you design a
survey where you're testing

for a thing but you're still obscure

about the thing you're
trying to ask about.

- So you still see it as a survey?

- Yeah. Yeah.
- Like an application?

'Cause I think he tweeted as saying like,

"I'm thinking of just like
showing up to San Francisco

"and saying, is anybody
open for casual sex?"

Something like this. Am I, misremembering?

- Maybe escorting. I'm not sure.

- Oh, for, sorry, sorry, sorry.

- Which is similar.

I kind of use escorting

as the way to have casual sex now.

- Okay. So let's talk about escorting.

So you wrote about
escorting your blog post.

"Escorting was good for me."

How did you get into escorting?

- I was working at like a,

I quit camming 'cause I was burned out

and I was like trying to
work at a friend's startup

and it was hard for me.

It's difficult for me to work on projects

that are not my projects.

And so I was like, hey, fuck it,

I wanna go back to sex work,
I wanna make more money,

but I don't wanna cam
anymore cause I'm burned out.

So I'm like, "Well, let's try,"

I have a friend who is an escort,

I'm like, "let's try that."

And so we had a call,

she like outlined the basics for me

and then I put up some ads
and then started working.

- What's the basics of escorting?

How's that work?

- If you wanna get started at escorting.

- I would like to.
- So just as you

have a career change.

You gonna want to get some nice photos,

so you probably have those.
- First of all,

you assumed I haven't done it before,

how rude.
- Oh, have you?

- Yeah. Well, you know, recreationally,

I'd like to do professionally I suppose.

So if I wanted to do it, (laughs)

if I wanted to do it,

if I really, really wanna step up my game,

how would I do it?

- (laughs) Yeah. Well you
got the whole tutorial.

Well, recreational escorting is just?

Okay. Okay.

- No, meaning like, you know,

like, selling products on
Etsy versus doing a startup.

- Well, I mean escorting

is kind of also selling products on Etsy.

- No, like, but selling a lot of products-

- Like, high volume.

(both laughing)

- High volume.
- You've like dabbled?

- Yeah, I got, like yeah, yeah.

- Small handcrafted-
- It's a small handcrafted

dolls. Yeah.
- Artisan. (laughs)

Escorting. (laughing)

- [Lex] Versus mass manufacturer.

- Okay. If you wanna mass
manufacturer your escort.

- I just feel like I haven't
been getting, you know,

I've been undervaluing my services,

and I would like to really step up.

- I think you could
really just like grease

some marketing gears and be-.

- Yeah, I mean, so some of
this is marketing, so like,

I guess I wanna, like, know,

is it similar to camming in that way?

Like is it, you're basically
advertising yourself

and you're (sighs) like the marketing,

all the creativity that you
mentioned before, all of that.

- Yeah. I found escorting
to be pretty easy

because escorting is not
like highly competitive.

For example camming is highly competitive

because like the thing
that I outlined before,

you know, the amount
of money that you make

determines your ranking,

and you can also go and see other girls.

You can see what they're doing.

So if a girl figures
that incredible strategy

for making money,

it's like two seconds before that strategy

proliferates into everybody else.

So it's very fast-paced
and like really tough.

With escorting you don't get to see

what other girls are doing.

You can look at their websites, but like,

you don't know what they're
doing with clients at all.

You can look at their
rates but you don't know

what their volume is.

So you don't actually
know what is successful

and what isn't very much.

So I think there's much less
like evolution of marketing

through this process.

And so I came in with like my
aggressive marketing skills

from being a cam girl.

I think that really helped.

I did very well as an escort.

I just came in like made a
fantastic website, you know,

I knew how to do the ads right.

- What was the finding people,

I guess it's also like finding
the right kind of customer,

the right kind of client?

- I got like in a lot of
trouble for this recently

in the sex workers sphere because I said

that if you raise prices,

you're more likely to encounter clients

that aren't going to abuse you.

Like it's safer.

They did not, they said
that I was being classist,

you know, implying that poor
people are more violent.

But to be fair,

if you are a guy and you wanna
be violent towards a woman,

you're probably not gonna be
paying her a lot of money.

You're probably gonna be like,

you're the kind of person likely
who's going to haggle a lot

'cause you don't respect her.

But anyway, that aside, it's
a little pet peeve for me.

Yeah. I just, I started
charging 800 an hour

and then pretty rapidly raise it to 1,200,

and then a while after
that raise it to 1,400.

- Well the interesting thing you mentioned

in my extensive research,

you used to do 1,200 to 1,400
an hour and then you said

that you were thinking of jumping back in

at a rate of 2,400 the first hour.

- [Aella] Yeah.

- And I think 900 each successive hour.

That's interesting.

That's like, I mean, to me
that's really interesting.

Like why, it's like a lot on-
- Why the discrepancy?

first hour? Yeah.

- Oh, it's just because it's depends

on how you wanna incentivize

like the amount of hours.

So if you have to pay a
lot for the first hour,

but not very much for the successive,

you're more likely to buy
like a longer period of time.

And usually I find that clients who buy

a longer period of time are nicer to you.

I don't have like a great
theory for why that is,

but there's, they're more likely like,

take you dinner and get to know you first.

And I just enjoy that a lot more.

I enjoy like knowing who
I'm gonna have sex with.

Like a date, you know?

- Yeah. So it's incentivize
the long-form date dynamic

versus like not.

That's really interesting.

That's really interesting.

How does money change the dynamic,

just basic human dynamic
of interacting for free

versus for money?

Like, I think about that a lot

'cause, like, just talking to rich people,

it's like you should
get paid for your time

and you're doing this for free.

Like what? (laughs)

Like what's the difference?

Is there a difference really or no?

- A bit. Yeah, so I've
actually, it depends a lot.

So when I was doing it full-time,

it was my only source of income.

It changed quite a lot
because I was really

incentivized to have repeat customers.

So I'm like, "Okay, if my
primary interaction with you

"is to, like, have you hire me again.

"I'll do whatever that
takes to make that happen.

"And so if I have to like laugh at jokes

"that I don't find funny or
like, or be like more adoring

"of your penis than I
actually genuinely feel,

"like, that's what I'm going to express."

And obviously it's to
some degree like titrated,

you know, like, it's
unpleasant to force yourself

to like something that you don't.

So like I would actually
like not see clients again

that I didn't want to.

But it's just some degree
there was this, sort of,

self-suppression going on,

which I think is this the way it works

in any sort of customer service job.

Like you want the customer to leave happy,

so you just make sure that
you are happy the whole time,

and you're like, "Ah, really
enjoying the other person."

But so recently when I've
like kind of dabbled in it

since making money for through other means

where I don't need the money,

it's more like a fun side
thing that like, that I'm,

like I said, it's fulfilling
the role of casual sex for me.

So like, I don't have to do it,

this is not my primary job,

I just want sort of a good excuse

to like have sex with somebody,

and the money is like a
great filter for that.

And so in that case-

- That's interesting.

So the money is just, yeah, okay,

the money is basically
a filter for somebody

who's taken this interaction seriously.

- Yeah. It also,

so there's an interesting
like psychological thing

where I have difficulty having casual sex

with somebody because
some part of my brain,

which I assume is like quite female,

is doing some evaluation of
status and whether or not

this is going to damage my reputation

by having sex with them.

So like if you found out that
I went and like had random sex

with like a homeless man,

you might be like, "Wow, that
says something about Aella.

"Like maybe she's, you know, trashy

"or she just has no standards
for who she's gonna fuck."

And so some part of me
is continually anxious.

I'm like, "Does this
mean I have no standards

"if I decide to have casual sex with you?

"Like what are people going to think?"

And so if you introduce money,
it takes away that anxiety.

I don't have to worry
about it because it's like,

"Oh, of course Aella would
have sex with that person,

"they paid her.

"Like this is not an
indication of the kind of mate

"that she can get, this
is just an indication

"of like a business transaction."

And this allows me to enjoy
casual sex so much more

when somebody pays me for it.

To the degree that, like,
I almost view it as a kink.

And so it's like, so I'm
using it sort of to replace

casual sex now, like occasionally.

Like pay me a little
bit to erase the anxiety

and I'll like have a fun time.

- I mean, can you see
like dinner like that

or something like that?

If the person pays for dinner or like,

so like it's all just,
if any money's involved,

if it's a kink, then you
could just like use it,

and you, (laughs) he buys
a coffee at a Starbucks.

It's like, all right.

- Right. But it has to be plausible.

Like you have to like trick
my brain into like having it

actually be incentivizing for me.

It's not like-
- Two coffees

like cappuccino or something.

- Yeah, like, the homeless
man bought me a coffee

and then I sucked his dick.

Like that's not cool. (laughs)

- All right.

No, no shame of homeless men by the way.

Like I've been friends with a lot of them,

I'm just using like some
sort of stereotype of,

right now.
- Yeah,(laughs).

So like, it has to be plausible

where you could trick your mind.

Interesting.
- Yeah.

I mean, yeah. (chuckles)

- And so that's different.

So now in this sort of
frame, I am still like,

I'm accepting money but
still much more expressive

of my actual preferences.

So like before when I would
start escorting full-time

I was suppressive and
now I'm like, you know,

"Fuck it, I'm doing this for me,

"so we're going to make sure
that I have a good time.

"And so I'm much more demanding."

- And then you're having more fun

'cause you're not pretending-
- Exactly.

- Or laughing at a joke
or something like that.

That sounds terrible.

Sounds like.
- I mean, it's-

But it's also like social.

I mean, I guess I would,

would I do that?

Like when you first meet people,

like strangers and so on,

there's some aspect of like niceties,

but like, I don't know, intimacy,

like real intimacy requires
like getting past the niceties.

Like laughing at somebody's
joke when it's not funny

feels like anti intimacy.

- Yeah. But I laugh at so
many jokes automatically.

It's interesting because
like, I don't mean to,

I'm not trying to be fake.

But like if I'm in a group of people

and somebody makes a
joke and everybody laughs

I laugh even before I'm
checking within myself.

Like, "Do I genuinely enjoy this joke?"

So it's like, I don't know,

like the degree that I am
sort of just like a result

of social programming in all cases,

that like when I'm with a client,

back when I was doing it full-time,

like it doesn't feel
significantly different,

it just felt like a
different version of myself.

- Yeah, that's true.

Yeah. To that degree.

To to the degree you don't
feel like you're going against

your nature, yeah.

- Yeah. It was very rare that
I actually felt like I was

going against my nature.

- What about the market
of how much to charge?

So 2,400. Like how
transparent is that market?

Is there like a market?

- Like how much can you sell

when you're charging that much?

- Yeah, no, like what
what are the competitors?

Like if this-
- Oh yeah.

- Are you distinctly working,

'cause you said it's,

a lot it is a bit more
shrouded in mystery.

Like I guess more confidential.

Like do you have some
transparency to the market?

what the competitors are?

- I did a survey of escorts.

It's only like 130,

I'm trying to remember.

And the median was around
like $300 I think an hour.

- [Lex] Oh wow.

- Something like that, with a
very long tail at the top end.

But I'm trying to remember what the,

I also asked in the amount
where I could calculate

the amount they made per month.

I think it was like 6 or $7,000 a month.

I need to double check that one.

- I charge 50 bucks an hour.

- You charge 50 bucks an hour,
you should raise your rates.

- Yeah. I believe I give
a really shitty hand job.

All right.

- But usually the rates are around,

like if you want a median
escort in a big city,

it's usually 4 to $600.
- A city.

For us, 4 to 600?
- In a big city.

But like smaller cities do
you charge the rates go lower.

- That's so fascinating.

What's like the most you've
ever seen somebody charge?

- I think I am.

- You're like the?

- But at this point it's
because I'm post work.

Like I can just put it insane number.

- Does like the fact that you're sort of

like a sexuality expert,
like a researcher and so on,

like your mind is fascinating as well,

and you're a bit of a celebrity,
does that play into it?

- [Aella] Yeah.

- Or do you feel the celebrity now,

like when you're with people?

- Yeah, absolutely.

Usually if people are interested
in hanging out with me

it's because of that.

But that's different.

Like, I think besides like the fun part,

this is a kink as
opposed to this is a job,

like with this as a job,
usually the high-end

is closer to 2,000 an hour,
like the very high end.

- Have clients ever
fallen in love with you?

- I think so, yeah.

I think it happens to me much less

than most other people due
to like the thing I think

we were talking about before.

- [Lex] Which is what?

- Where like, you know, you give off vibes

maybe like subconscious vibes.

- But they have fallen in
love or not, but not as often.

- I think something about
my signaling indicates

that people should not
fall in love with me

'cause I don't think it happens very much.

It happens a lot with
other women that I know.

But I have occasionally had,

the thing is it's hard
for me because I try to be

as vulnerable as I can in
a connection with a client.

And like, I do really like some of them.

I still remember some of them
very fondly and I'm like,

I hope they're doing well.

And some of them are really profound.

Like, one guy saw me because he found out

he was dying of cancer and he was like,

"I don't wanna die
without seeing someone."

I'm like, "Jesus Christ, that's such a,"

I don't know, I'm very
touched by many of the people

that I saw.

- So there's like deep intimacy there.

- Yeah. I know that it's brief

and I know that it's like kind of weird,

but like there's like a real
glimpse into somebody's soul

when you get to be intimate.

And I think this is
especially true for men

because a lot of time
men don't have like a way

to be really vulnerable
in front of anybody.

But like if you're in bed
with a woman that you find

to be attractive, you can, sort of,

let loose a little bit more.

- So they can become
vulnerable in general quickly.

- Yeah. And I really like that.

I like being as vulnerable
as I can to match it.

Like I'm not forcing myself or anything,

but like I just feel
into it and like notice

how beautiful the person was,

and like feel grateful
for being able to be

in this intimate experience with them.

And that was so wonderful.

- Does it ever hurt to say goodbye?

- No. But I think that is unique to me

because I like being alone a lot.

Even with my friends who I like dearly,

I'm like happy not seeing them.

'cause I don't like making
facial expressions very much,

but I do miss some of my clients.

- Wait, sorry.

What does making facial expression

have to do with saying goodbye?

- Well, if you are not
with somebody in person,

you don't have to make
facial expressions anymore.

- Oh, you can just think about them.

- Yeah, you can just sit
there totally blank faced

and then have all of the
emotions that you want.

- [Lex] Oh, you're telling me.

- Do you have this thing too?

- It's not a thing, but
like you're on camera.

So like I feel feelings,

but people usually want
you, like social interaction

is such that, like, you probably
want me to show feelings

on my face.
- Yeah.

Like that, good job.

- Yeah, there you go.

So like, I definitely,

there could be just an introvert thing

where you like have a vibrant inner world

that you forget to show to
to the rest of the world.

And also I'm scared of social interaction,

I just have a lot of
anxiety about interacting

with the external world. So yeah.

- I'm kinda surprised to hear that

because when you talked
about like finding the light

and everything, and everything is fun.

Like I usually don't
associate that with having

not very much anxiety.

- Well, because I have the,
we mentioned that earlier,

I just appreciate the beauty
in the world when I observe it.

But then when I'm interacting with others,

I have a very harsh
self-critical aspect to my brain

that says, like, "You're
gonna fuck this up.

"You're gonna fuck up this interaction.

"You're gonna fuck up
the beauty that's there."

If I'm sort of being fragile
and vulnerable for a moment.

One of the things I'm afraid
of, I get so much love

from people that listen
or even like reach out,

like you said, through the
survey, like women and so on.

I'm afraid that yeah, you know,

you admire me because you don't know me,

but you won't admire me once you know me.

So that self-critical, but it's a silly,

I mean as you get older
you're like, "Yeah, okay."

Like I'm able to step away
and objectively look at myself

as like, there's no, this is, you're fine,

you're good. (laughs)

It's like, but it's still
there's the part of the brain

that you can't just shut off.

- Like what would fucking up
in this conversation look like?

Like it doesn't have to be rational,

but I'm curious if there's
like a specific thing?

- A lot of it is just a
feeling like an amorphous fear,

a failure, what it would
actually look like.

Maybe because we're
talking about sexuality,

me not being able to eloquently
explain the worldview I have

and why I appreciate it.

That would make me feel like a failure

because that would make me feel like

maybe you don't know
what you're doing, right.

Because sexuality, not sexuality,

but even romantic relationships
are really important

to happiness, they're
really important to me.

And I'm not sure like the
conception of love I have,

romantic love is like fully made rigorous.

So especially when I'm talking to you

that thinks very rigorously
about a lot of these topics,

I'm not sure if I've
thought about them a lot.

I feel them. I interact with the world

in a space of feelings.

Maybe I'm almost afraid
to be very rigorous

with these kinds of thoughts.

And so I think the failure would be like,

I would be confronted with
the fact that I can't explain

what makes me happy.

That could be a failure,

and there could be just a
bunch of other failures.

Another big failure is like not,

I think you're a really brilliant person,

and a lot of folks I know,

know and admire your work as well.

And so like for me not to
be part of highlighting

that brilliance would
be a failure definitely.

- Like, because then other
people might feel like,

like notice the discrepancy or something?

- Yeah, but no, no, no,
that's not other people,

just my personal feeling.
- Oh, I see.

- And then like the other is like jokes

'cause like we're
talking about sex, right,

so for me, like it's
fun to just joke around,

but you also have to tread
carefully because like,

it's a weird surface
because like, you know,

even I already feel bad about
making a joke for 50 bucks

for a hand job that's crappy by me.

But I think, (laughs),

I think sometimes you
just gotta go for it.

I went for it.

It kind of fell flat on its face.

But that's the thing
with the conversation.

- I think there's like
this fear where it's like,

if you become like
scientific about something

you'll figure out that your
feelings are unjustified

and then you'll experience
this horrible thing where like,

ah, shit, like, "I'm like afraid of this,

"but I'm sort of being
forced to by my logical mind

"to like believe this thing."

Which I don't think this is true at all.

I think like your feelings
are there for a reason,

like they're for a good reason.

And like logic or like
rigorous analysis or something

should be dedicated to
figuring out why it's there.

Not to like suppress it or
tell it it shouldn't be there.

- What do you think is
more important to like,

to just life?

Is it reason versus emotion?

Like not life, to what
makes us human, I guess?

- My romantic narrative answer to this,

which is like not rigorous
at all, is curiosity.

- Curiosity.
- Yeah.

- What, is curiosity?

That's such a middle (laughs)

curiosity is like both emotion and reason,

right?
- Yeah.

- So it's like this pull
'cause reason is the tool

you use to figure out the puzzle,

and then curiosity is the
pull towards the puzzle.

- Yeah. I don't like worldview
that pit like emotion

and rationalities opposite each other.

They feel like beautiful parts
of like a cohesive whole.

Like if you're doing
rationality to the extent

where you're like suppressing

some emotional reactions you have,

then I think you're doing it wrong,

you're like missing a big part of it.

Like it should be like integrated.

It should be like part
of like one unified flow.

Like the things that you like,

if you wanna be in a romantic,
committed relationship

for the rest of your life,

then this is like beautiful,
and good, and the kind of like

logic that you're using to make
sense of the world should be

fitted into that correctly.

I think that's really cool.

Like anytime you have
sort of like an internal

at odds thing with it,

I think you're like using
some sort of force to suppress

one or the other.

Like, "I'm not allowed
to reason about this,

"or I'm not allowed to feel about that."

And that feels harsh to me.

And I think curiosity is the solution.

Like if you're simply just calmly curious,

"Oh, why do I feel like that?

"Let's go find out,
that's so cool," right.

Like you can use logic and your feelings

to like discover the answer.

- Do you sometimes, 'cause
you do this kind of technique,

which is interesting and
I've mentioned it to others,

you'll sometimes step away

from like a third person perspective

and describe the feeling you're feeling.

Or like even just the situation,

like you'll step out and talk about,

"Wait, what is happening here?"

- [Aella] Like in the conversation itself.

- In the conversation itself.

First of all, what is that?

Do you find that to be
useful and interesting

'cause it's, it's very interesting.

It's feels raw and honest.

The danger of it seems like you
escape the actual experience

of it though.

So that's the trade off.

You make it intellectual, right.

- Is it though, intellectual to do that?

Maybe it is. I don't mean to...

- No, maybe that's the wrong word.

You can make it intellectual.

But you can still continue the same flavor

'cause you're not fully
disengaging from the conversation,

you're just creating an extra meta layer,

that's happening at the same time-

- I think exploring the emotional reaction

to what's going on in the moment.

- Yeah, in some ways it's
actually making it stronger,

or enriching it, like making it more,

giving it more context,
giving a deeper understanding-

- I think there's like a way of going meta

that is a flinch move.

Like, "Oh I noticed that
we're doing this thing,

"I'm gonna name it."

And I think the thing
that I described earlier,

like when the homeless guy
approached me and asked,

you know, "Can you go home with me?"

And I was like,

"Are you trying to have
sex with me right now?"

Like what I was doing is like a meta,

like you're stepping
outside like, and like okay,

what is the purpose of this conversation?

And we explicitly identify it.

And in that case I think that
is sort of like a flinch move.

Like I'm not telling him
my emotional response,

I'm not like being fully present,

I'm like sort of identifying
it as a way to subvert

what's going on.

And I absolutely think
this is a possible thing,

but I usually try to be
aware of that myself.

And it depends on the
purpose of what's going on.

- That guy, 'cause that is actually,

it's like a chess move you did,

you had a purpose of that chess move,

but the flirtation is on.

Like he could've like done a
better move that would make you

like curious like, "Huh!"
- Yeah, that's true.

- Like interesting 'cause
you had an agenda with that,

but he could've changed your mind.

Like, he could've, with a few words,

'cause you just created extra layers,

extra entry points.

- If he had gotten more
meta , I might've been like,

"Okay, well, now I am
gonna sleep with you."

(both laughing)

- Exactly. And see there is something

Yeah. That aids into the
chemistry of the conversation

when you do that meta.

I really enjoy it.

It's like a rare, I forget, did you not,

I forget who, I've had a
few people do that with me.

Like just in conversation and
I feel like you were involved

somehow 'cause I've met
you before somewhere.

I don't know if we were,

or you were just,
- We were

at a couple parties together.

- Oh, maybe it was just
like a bunch of people

that kind of play with the same are

like uncomfortable.
- They're circling.

It's just a practice explicitly
dedicated towards that.

- What's circling?

- Circling s's like this-
- That might be the thing-

- Yeah, I think so.

We know we have some
mutual circlers in our-

- Circlers (chuckles).
- In our network here.

- What's circling?

I don't remember what circling-

- I'm gonna describe it horribly,

'cause it's like one of
those things that's difficult

to describe unless you experience it.

Like, kind of like drugs.

But it's something like you sit around,

there's like kind of
guidelines to the conversation

where you talk about the present moment.

And you're like honest
about your experiences

as much as you can be.

And if you don't wanna
be honest, then you say,

I don't wanna be honest.

And like commitment to connection.

So like you're here to
like actually connect

with the other person and
understand them and be understood.

You're not supposed to like project,

so if you're like have an
analysis about the other person,

you own it, you're like, "I'm
experiencing you as this,"

you know, and then you check is it true.

- Are you supposed to be almost
like converting into words

the thing you're
thinking, like constantly?

Are you supposed to say
what you're thinking,

- If it feels right in
the moment, you can.

The thing is it's very amorphous, right,

it's like almost like
creating a magical sensation.

And I've been with some, I've
seen some very good circlers,

really high skill circle
and I feel like I'm on drugs

when that happens.

It's very rare to see.

- Does it feel honest somehow?

- Yeah. Very honest.

Like, right now in this moment
I'm feeling like kind of,

like, nervous energy
because I'm talking to you,

and this is a unique situation,

and like I want you to think I'm cool.

I want everybody listening
to me to think I'm cool,

but I'm also having some sort
of delight at being able to

express in this way and like
some admiration for how you,

like, set up and built this thing

that I can be a part of.

And all of these things are
sort of in my body right now

as this sort of vibrating high thing.

- I remember, like, in the party setting

'cause I've had to talk to a few people,

I felt like it was going
sexual very quickly.

- Okay. I don't know if you remember this,

but the first time I met you
I didn't know who you were,

I just heard, I knew I'd heard your name,

like I'd heard your name and like ,

I think I've heard people discuss that.

And I was in the middle of
a very sexual conversation

with another woman.
- Oh you were?

- Yeah I was.

And you just like turned around and left

very shortly afterwards.

And I thought it very-

- Oh was I listening
in on the conversation

or something like that?

- I think, it was like
I was talking to her

and you were just kind
of like right there,

and so we introduced ourselves
and then we continued on

with a conversation.

You were like standing
there and listening.

- Yeah. I don't think I would've left the,

so it's funny, you probably
interpret it in a different way.

It sounds like-
- I interpret it

as you like not wanting to listen

to like graphic sexual stuff.

- Was it like super graphic?

- I don't know, I was asking
her about, I was doing,

I was interviewing her
about her fetish basically.

- Oh yeah. I don't think I
would've walked away from that.

I would've been like curious.

Oh, interesting, 'cause
I don't often see people

having a deep interview about fetishes.

Like I wouldn't even be,

listen, I'm like Jane Goodall here.

(both laughing)

I'm not like,
(both laughing)

I'm not afraid of sexuality
or something like that.

I just have certain values
in terms of like monogamy

and so on.

But I think-
- Okay, that's good.

- Sexuality is really beautiful, yeah.

I don't think, yeah, I can't
imagine myself walking away

from that conversation.

- Someone who must have like
called you or something-

- Yes, probably.
'Cause I didn't remember

exactly how it worked,

I just remember thinking later on-

- [Lex] Or maybe I
thought I was intruding.

- Oh, maybe.

I was kind of drunk.

- And I probably was very drunk too.

(Aella laughing)

- I would like to
actually have like footage

of that conversation so
we can actually interpret

what actually happened

because it's probably, I mean, you know,

human interactions are funny like that,

they can happen for all kinds of reasons.

Have you ever fallen
in love with a client?

- No. I mean like in tiny
ways, like micro loves.

- Have you ever fallen in love, love?

- I mean, I don't know what
it means, but probably.

The thing that other
people say when they say

fall in love is probably
something I've experienced.

- What do you think they mean?

What is love, Aella?

- Yeah, I know.
- No.

- It's a fantastic question.

I think, so love is one
of those words that refers

to like a billion different concepts,

and I think we maybe
should just taboo the term

to have a better understanding
what we're referring to.

'Cause there's things like
feeling intense attachment,

there's something feeling
like soulfully aligned,

there's like sexual attraction,

there's like excitement.
- Are you talking to me

and saying we should taboo the term love

in this conversation.
- Maybe.

- How dare you.
(Aella laughing)

Well, it's (laughs), okay.

Romantic love-

- To make it flourish into
lots of other new definitions.

- Okay. Thank you.

- We're expanding love.

- It sounds like you're censoring
the most important word.

This is like 1984 all over again.

(Aella laughing)
Okay.

Also on the book a reading list.

Okay. Listen, no, romantic love,

like a deep intimacy for somebody,

like a deep connection with a human being

that is also,

I mean, yeah, with polyamory
is tricky and your relationship

with sex is also tricky.

So like what's the difference
between a deep friendship

and a friendship that also
has a sexual component?

- I remember being very
confused about that

when I did a lot of LSD.

I was like, what?

The line between romantic
relationships and everything else

kind of got blurred.

I was like, "Oh, I'm
just like in intimacy."

And some intimacies mean that you spend

your life together more and have sex.

But like the same basic thing is there,

like you're seeing someone
for like who they are.

- Do you think you can be,
if you're heterosexual,

do you think you could be
really deeply close with friends

with a guy and not have
sexual relations with him?

- I assume it's possible.

Like if anything is ever
possible then probably yeah-

- Well, everything is possible,
time travel is possible.

Quantum mechanics makes every,

traveling faster than the
speed of light is possible,

according to general relativity
everything is possible.

So you're saying there's
a chance "Dumb and Dumber"

has taught me that everything

is fucking possible.
- It's probably

not super likely assuming

that they are like
attracted to each other.

- Yeah. And for somebody that does surveys

and statistical analysis,

we're interested in like
what's the likely thing here

versus, like, what's possible.

If you say possible it's
like, well anything's open.

- Did you just avoid
answering the love thing?

Okay, I have-
- I have a lot to say

about love, it's just
I like to be precise.

- Yeah. Okay.

Let's be precisely imprecise and continue.

- Oh sorry, that's my phone.

(Lex laughing)

- It feels like a passive
aggressive suggestion

that we shouldn't talk about love anymore,

but we shall continue.

- No, we should absolutely
talk about love,

it's just the term is very confusing,

'cause it's like some
people say the word love

and the thing that they're
thinking of is like,

"Oh, the butterfly is
like the sparkle thing

"that I get in my stomach when
I think about my loved one."

But I study relationships over time.

I just released, like,
I did a survey about it,

and that sparkle goes away
within like two to four years,

but people still report loving
their partner after that.

So I'm like, okay,

like, when you say the word love

what the fuck are we talking about?

- Yeah. Okay.
- I just wanna get

on the same page.

- Okay. So what are the
different, so the butterflies,

boy, I'd like to push back
that two to four years

on the butterflies, but okay.

- [Aella] I mean,
statistically. Not everybody.

- Butterflies don't give
a fuck about statistics.

You ever heard of, like,
the flap of a butterfly wing

causing like nuclear war?

(Aella laughing)

How do you describe that
with your statistics?

Okay, so butterflies,
that's basic infatuation,

the chemistry of the
initial interactions, sure.

But a deep meaningful connection like,

that feels like sexuality
is a component of that.

Like the kind of intimacy
that's only possible

when you're also sexual
with another human being.

On top of that you have the
butterfly, and on top of that

you have the friendship,
and on top of that

you have like, what is that?

That's a sandwich full of things.

- [Aella] The love sandwich.

- The love sandwich.

- Okay. I'm down to
calling it a love sandwich.

- We'll you just call sandwich, L-S. Okay.

What role does that play
in the human condition?

- You asking about the human condition.

It's an interesting phrase.

- [Lex] Yeah.

- I'm like, this is, like,
not a phrase that's common

in my own thinking.

- Sure. Human condition is
a good summary, you know,

on what do you think, what do you feel

when I say human condition.
- I ask very different

kinds of questions than you.

- Sure. Yeah.
- Which is interesting.

I've been trying to like figure
out like what kind of brain

like you have as like creating, like,

this category of question?

Which is why I was saying,

there's something about a
poetic narrative in there

because it's very like aesthetic.

I think you've asked much
more aesthetic questions

than I do.

- I don't even know what the
word aesthetic means, really.

- Like artistic.
- Artistic.

Well, I mean I know what aesthetic means,

but I also don't know what it means.

It's kind of like the word love.

Aesthetic perspective.

Yeah. Well, but part
of it in conversation,

you don't wanna ask a question

that has an answer fully, always.

- Like, do you have an
example of a question

that has that?

- What's the meaning,
oh, does has an answer?

- Yeah. Like one that you like,

"Ah, that's like a bad question
because it has an answer."

- How many sexual partners have you had

in the last year?

- Oh my God.

That's such a, (laughs), okay,

I feel like we just like
got to some sort of crux

about, like, the kinds of questions

that we like to answer.
- Sure.

- (laughs) 'Cause I
would love that question.

- [Lex] Okay. Right.

- To ask it of people.

- All right, but does
that really tell the story

of what you've felt over the past year?

- That's true. But then
I could just tell you.

Okay. So by when you're
saying the kinds of questions

that you liked, the ones
that don't have an answer;

by not an answer, you
mean like, not an answer

where you can know that
you're done telling it?

- Is that-
- So you can escape

having to think by actually answering it.

- I see.
- Yeah.

The struggle is the place
where we discover something

not the destination (laughing) consensual.

Okay, it's working, its working.

Okay. So what is the
role of the love sandwich

in the human condition?

- Okay, that's fine.

I take that question back,
it's a stupid question.

- You don't have to, I'm ready to try-

- Do you like love?

Do you personally

like love?
- Do I like love?

Yeah, I mean, I think,
like, there's a part of me

that feels like I have
unconditional love for all things.

Like when you're talking about
the glass being beautiful.

I felt that, like, that feels like,

it felt like it rang
something that like I have

a similar resonance in me for that.

- If I were to circle right now,

I feel like you're
avoiding the love question,

the love sandwich question.

What's your own personal
feeling towards loving

another human being versus

having sex with another human being?

- Love is like one of the concepts

that dissolved for me a long time ago,

so I have difficulty
directly answering it.

But I have the experience,

when you described the love sandwich,

I feel like I have had that experience.

I have it currently for some people also.

Like I'm dating people and I have that.

- So people who you date,

you would describe sharing
a love sandwich with them.

- Yeah. (chuckles)

- Okay. So how does,

(both laughing)

I mean, that's great to hear.

So you're not, are you afraid of love?

- No, not at all.

- So can you describe to me

polyamory, what is it?

What does it mean?

'Cause there's like different terms.

You have a nice blog post about it.

- Yeah, I have a personal
definition of it,

which I readily admit is not
shared by a lot of people.

But to me the definition of polyamory

is simply not forbidding your partner

from pursuing intimacy with others.

It doesn't mean that you
have to pursue it personally.

Like two people could be
married and only have had sex

with each other for 20 years,

and as long as they're like,

"You know what, if ever
you wanna go have sex

"with somebody else,
you're welcome to do that."

- Well the interesting thing you said is,

that doesn't mean they have to do it,

they just have the freedom to do it.

- Yeah, it's the freedom
that matters to me.

- Which is, I mean, it's
called 'The Polyamory Post".

You have so many good blog posts.

People should just go look at your,

read your writing.

It's really, really strong
and often backed by data,

but also just a deeply
honest look at yourself

and your understanding of the world.

Yeah, it's refreshing to me,

like with a lot of stuff I disagree with,

but I feel like if I disagree
with it you'll be very open

in arguing it and kind
of thinking through it.

There's just the honesty that
radiates from the whole thing.

Anyway. So yeah, It would be interesting

to kind of explore what
polyamory, like how it works,

what are the different versions,

what does that freedom look like?

What what does that freedom feel like

to be able to go see other people?

- Depends on you.

Like, do you wanna go see other people?

Maybe you do, maybe you don't.

So usually for me,

I tend to be pretty happy
with like one or a few people.

And then occasionally
I like some novelties.

So usually I'll go, like,
I host orgies sometimes,

so I'll host an orgy and then
I'll go have sex with people

at the orgy and then that'll be good

for the novelty for a while.

- Can I ask you about orgies?
- Yeah.

- So how many people are in orgy?

What's like a standard,
we're having a Sunday picnic

and it's an orgy, what's
like a number of people

at an orgy?

- Oh, it depend. I've been,

I've only recently started hosting orgies,

but I have been to a lot of orgies,

and I would say, like, the
median is maybe 15 people.

- I like how you say
median versus mean. Okay.

Median is 15 people.

What's the gender distribution usually?

- Usually about even.

It's like ideal if you can get

more women than men in most of them.

I've recently been
hosting free-use orgies,

or orgies where consent
is assumed by default

when you enter.

And of course you can revoke it anytime,

we go over a whole bunch
of rules to make sure

it's very safe, you like have wristbands,

so nobody's actually doing anything

they don't want to but-
- Wristbands, nice.

- In those ones you have to
have more men than women.

- I thought free-use was like
consensual like at any time,

but it's at any time
within the constraints

of this building or something like that?

- Yeah, so at the orgies
it's like you, by entering,

if you wear a wristband
then you are like by default

opting into consent.

So people don't have to like
do a thing where they negotiate

with you and like be like, "Is this okay?"

It's just the default is
like you just go for it.

And if they want you to stop,

they say the safe word like "Red don't,"

and then you have to stop.

And we do like exercise in the beginning

of people saying red to make
sure that everybody knows

exactly what the rules are.

- What's your favorite safe word?

- Red.
- Red.

- When I first started
doing like weird kinky shit,

I was like, "Oh let's make a safe word,"

and we picked the word foliage.

I was like, "That's goofy right?"

But then eventually came a
time where I did actually,

in fact, wanna say the safe word

and I couldn't-
- Couldn't think of it.

- I was like in agony I was like crying,

I'm like I can't make myself
say this stupid word right now.

- Foliage.

- So after that I was
like red, doesn't matter,

I don't care, that's not funny,

we're just going with very simple red-

- Very practical.

How does an orgy compare
sexually to like a one-on-one

sexual experience?

Like what, is it same ballpark

or is it fundamentally different?

- I mean the experience of
both orgies and one-on-one sex

carry like really high variety.

- It's a high variety-
- You kind of,

it's a little bit like you're
having sex with someone

but you're surrounded by
really realistic VR porn

of other people having sex.

- [Lex] Oh, okay, cool.

- And sometimes there's
like three sums also,

like maybe there's
another person involved,

but it's hard to like have
a whole bunch of people

in one cluster, 'cause usually
there's kind of different

little clusters of people
having their experience.

I once was part of a 10-woman orgy,

it was a total lesbian thing,

and that felt like a writhing
cluster was very nice.

But typically you kind of separate out

with like very small pods
of people doing stuff.

- Okay. So back to polyamory.

So what's a good, what,
what does it take to manage?

Do you have a main partner,

if you're being polyamorous and you have,

you're dating multiple people,

is there usually a main
one for you personally?

- For me personally kind of, yes.

Like right now I kind of, two that aren't,

like I see roughly, for me
it's kind of just descriptive.

Like if I just happen to
be seeing you a lot more

and I confide in you more than you,

like you're descriptively
my primary partner.

But I don't usually have
rules to protect that,

I'm down with rules to protect it

if you're like trying to build something,

like we gonna buy a house together,

I'd be like "Okay, we need to, like,

"whatever our relationship is,

"we have to do the thing where
we're both paying the rent

"for a house or the mortgage or whatever."

A lot of people do have primary sets,

it's very common to
have like prescriptive,

like I'm gonna get married to you,

and you're not allowed to like have

anal sex with anybody else.

That sort of thing.

- What about like the transparency

and the communication they have to do?

Do you usually try to be super honest

about everything.
- Extremely, yeah.

I mean I've learned over time
that like even if it seems

like a very small thing,

you talk about the small thing.

'Cause often I would
just sort of have, like,

a small twitch in myself,

"I don't know if I like that,

"but okay, is this really minor.

"It's probably nothing
and if I talk about it

"it's gonna make it into a thing.

"And I just don't wanna make
it into a thing," you know.

And I've come to realize that it's worth

making it into a thing because
I can't predict at the time

if like the small feeling
I have is going to grow.

And then when I grow it now
it's like much more difficult

to deal with.

So now it's like any little
bit of jealousy I have

I immediately communicate it.

I'm like, "Ah, I'm a little
jealous of you right now."

I don't hold that in at all.

I used to be kind of like,

back when I first started being poly,

I used to try to pretend that
I was not a jealous person

and that backfired quite a lot.

- That's really interesting.

So you do still feel jealousy?

- Oh yeah, definitely.

- And it's also interesting
that you kind of recommend

when there's a little
bit of jealousy, like,

to bring that to the surface.

- Yeah. Just like excessively communicate,

even if it feels stupid.

Like this is, I feel like a cliche,

I feel like a stupid
therapist training video,

like I just feel ridiculous sometimes

when I'm saying the things,

but it's just, I've learned over time

it's just important to
just say the things.

- 'Cause like, you know, the
traditional view of jealousy

is exactly like you said,

if you bring it up to the
surface, like, it's gonna sound

like you're overreacting to everything.

But you're saying like, still do it

because you're basically,

your brain blows stuff out of proportion.

- Yeah. And it's good to
like be going through it

with a partner.

Like, I have a partner
right now who's like dating

this other girl and he
like really likes her,

and he, like, went traveling
with her and stuff.

And I was like, "I feel jealous about it."

And I have to tell him that,

and that way he can be with me in it.

He like holds me when I'm feeling jealous,

and it's like a bonding
experience, you know.

But it's important for me that, like,

he's able to handle it.

Like, I try not to date
people who really freak out

when I have negative emotions.

Because I wanna be able
to express that I'm upset

by something they're doing

without it being taken as a demand

that they change their behavior.

- Right. So he has to be
able to skillfully handle

that interaction.
- Yeah.

He has to be like, cool.

"All right, you're jealous,

"I'm not gonna freak out about it,

"I'm not gonna change my behavior,

"I'm just gonna be with you in that.

"We're gonna sit in it together."

- I mean, is some of that just insecurity

that you should also just comfort,

like basically alleviate your insecurity,

bring you back to like a
rational objective evaluation?

- In my relationships,
I love it when people

do not reassure me.

I like not being comforted quite a lot.

And so usually the people I date don't,

I'm very gravitating.

Like, it's one of the things people do

to make me fall in love with
them is if I say something

really like terrible
and they're just like,

do not give me any comfort whatsoever.

That's where my heart gets captured.

So I typically am in
relationships where I'm like,

"Hug me I'm so jealous."

And they just like, do
not reassure me at all.

And that's good 'cause it
doesn't give me an out,

like I have to deal with it myself.

- [Lex] They're still there

to share it.
- Maybe it's true.

that the other woman is better than me.

Like, maybe that is an
actual possible reality.

- Would you like that?
- I don't wanna be dealing

with my life in a way where
I'm like pretending, like,

I'm only okay when that
reality is not true.

- Would you like them to say that,

that the other woman is better than you?

- Or that they prefer-
- If they feel that.

- Yeah. I mean they should say it

in according to themselves.

Like, "Oh, I prefer, like,

"I have a better time with
her than I have with you."

Than I would wanna know that. Yeah.

- And even though that
might be painful to hear.

- Yes.

That which can be destroyed
by the truth should be.

- That which can be
destroyed by the truth.

What was that,

that your ego or something like that?

- Yeah, my ego. (laughs)

- So your ego just generally grows

and you like the destruction of it.

- [Aella] Yeah.

It's like really accurate.
- It's the process of truth.

- It's not, it's like a fun experience.

Like, I've had like guys be like,

"well you're not as pretty as I'd like."

I'm just like, "Oh, you
know, stabbed to the heart."

- But then also like,
"Gimme your number, after.

- [Aella] Yeah. (laughs)

- Oh man, oh well,
that's kind of beautiful.

What do you think of
monogamous relationships,

like philosophically?

Can you maybe steal man or make the case

for monogamous relationships?

Can you understand the pros and cons

of monogamous relationships-

- Yeah. I mean, it depends on how you,

if you're like, "Hey you
can do whatever you want,

"but you and I are gonna spend the rest,"

like we just, you're
80 years old and like,

"Oh, we spent 60 years
in a marriage together,

"we've never had sex with anybody else."

I think that's, like, awesome.

If that's what you want, that's great.

I have like a little bit
more problems with people

doing that while also
forcing their partner

not to misbehave if they want to.

Like, if you're like,

"Oh, we only made it this
far in our relationship

"because I forced my partner
not to pursue an intimacy

"that she wanted to"

Then I feel like a little, like more like,

"Ah, I don't know if that's great."

- How do you know if it's
a real want or an intimacy?

Like checking out a attractive
person while being inside

a monogamous relationship?

Yeah. How do you score that?

Is that bad that the person
cannot pursue those feelings?

- I mean, it depends if they want to.

Like, I often find people attractive

if I don't wanna pursue.

I'm also okay with people
entering into agreements.

Like if you and I want to agree,

like I'm only going to enter this

'cause I'm gonna be so hurt
if you pursue somebody else,

so I'm not gonna pursue anybody else.

That seems fine to me.

But I also extend that
like if somebody's like,

"I don't want you to have any friends,

"I'm gonna feel really insecure if you,"

And like, okay, like if you
wanted to enter that agreement,

"like I feel the same way."

Like I think you should
have the right to do it

if this is what you want.

But I also kind of, I
feel like a little weird

about restricting your partner
from doing things, you know.

- Oh. But I guess if
you're honest about it,

and you put it on the table. (chuckles)

I don't want you to have
any friends. (laughs)

I want you to sit in a box. (laughs)

- [Aella] Yeah. I think a lot-

- I guess if you're like really honest,

but then if there's like,

if there's a power dynamic that, like,

you can be quite influential
in a relationship

in convincing your partner,

and it's sure sounds like you're honestly

agreeing to a thing, but
you're not really agreeing.

That's the, I mean part of that

is the beauty of relationships, right.

Like, it's messy. It can be messy.

It's hard to know what
you really want, right

- Yeah. I think that's mainly
my complaint with monogamy.

Like I'm down with like
conscious monogamy.

But I think so many relationships

are, like, monogamous by default.

Like, people it's not
actually right for them,

but they just get into it because culture

just doesn't give them another option.

- And they don't even ask
themselves the question,

is this right for me?

- Right. which like I'm a
weird-ass person who thinks

a lot of weird shit,
but I didn't even think

about polyamory an option

before I had heard that it existed.

And it was only when I first
met my first polyamorous couple

and I was like, "Oh, that's what I am.

"That's clearly the thing that I am."

- Yeah. It's funny
'cause to me monogamy is,

it's not a, it doesn't make
sense for it to be a default.

Like to me monogamy goes
against human nature.

That's in some sense,
like, romance is a fuck you

to the way the world works.

- Really?

- Yeah. Like it's a, like
Romeo and Juliet romance,

like traditional description
of what romance looks like

versus, like, sure there's a
million variations of that.

But in my head, like this partnership

that's for a long time together
is a kind of, you know,

like, I don't know, like "True Romance".

You know that movie, it's a
really fucking good movie.

- [Aella] I haven't seen it at all.

- Okay. There's just like,

you're together against the world.

I mean that's what close
friendship feels like.

It's like ride or die, right.

- Yeah.
- Like that.

I guess it doesn't, it can be,

it could span across multiple,

you can have multiple
partners in that way.

- [Aella] Yeah, absolutely.

- But I just don't see monogamy as like,

definitely not a default.

I would actually, like,
honestly would probably see

polyamory as a more natural default.

- I mean, I guess depends
on what you mean by default.

Like most of human history
has been sort of a weird mix.

It's like you get polygamy and monogamy

or the kind of the main arrangements.

But yeah-
- But I mean,

just like human nature, like I-

- Yeah. People are
attracted to other people

and they wanna...
- Yeah.

- Especially in longer term relationships.

I track, in my relationship survey,

I track the amount of cheating over time

in a relationship.

Like how long have you
been in this relationship

and how have you cheated?

- So what's the results of that?

- Men cheat a lot, women too,

but men cheat about
30% more than women do.

I also ask men and women
to predict if they think

their partner has cheated,

and people's predictions
were about the same.

So people, roughly, predicted
that their male or female,

like, spouse hadn't cheated
about the same rate,

but men cheated much more than women.

- So who was more correct
in their prediction though?

- So men were more correct
in their prediction

predicting women.

And women were more off,

women thought men cheated much
less than they actually did.

But (chuckles) both of them were off,

but like the male gap
was significantly more.

So yeah, I mean you're
right when you say monogamy

is not default, like I think
you're like really getting

at something, like human beings are just,

especially in long-term relationships,

it's difficult to only want one person.

But to be fair, I think
monogamy and commitment

are very different.

I think you'd be incredibly,

I've known so many very
long term super committed

poly couples that live
lives that look very similar

to the very romantic, monogamous couples.

Like children, houses, like 20 years.

And that works great for them.

- Yeah. Yeah.

I mean there's so much
to like open your mind to

in these kinds of conversations,
these kinds of ideas.

But I also realize like
some of the cake is baked.

Like, I have some assumptions

that are hard to break through.

- [Aella] Like what?

- For myself.

Like it's difficult for me to imagine

a polyamorous relationship
for me that would work.

- [Aella] Yeah?

- But I don't have enough data.

I don't have a, like I have very little,

but like at this point it's like,

I haven't eaten pizza in like 20 years

'cause I know I just
don't disappoint yourself,

I just eat low carb 'cause
it makes me feel good,

but there's so many
foods I haven't explored.

It's just like, well, I
know what I love (laughs)-

- Yeah, but you probably

are monogamous.
- You explore

every once in a while.

Yeah. And you kind of figure that out.

But at the same time
you're humbled by, like,

even talking to you or
looking at your data,

like sexuality is a fascinating topic

because it seems that we're very,

like we were talking about
very afraid of this topic.

Like to be really honest
with ourselves about it,

the whole like academic
research is afraid of it,

but it's so core to who
we are as human beings.

I gotta ask you about this.

I can't believe took
this long to get there,

but one of your many fascinating
surveys is on fetishes.

(sighs)

You wrote a blog post about it.

Probably several, 'cause
it's like a huge dataset-

- [Aella] Oh yes, it's
still in progress, yeah.

- So the one I'm referring
to is on popularity

and tabooness of various fetishes.

So what are some interesting takeaways?

I gotta pull up this graph,
'cause it's freaking epic.

- Yes. This is a big
graph and it has tabooness

as one axis and popularity as the other.

- Okay. For people who are just listening

on the x-axis as tabooness.
- Yeah.

- [Lex] Asked to rate how taboo

society viewed sexual interest.

And on the y-axis says;

"Percent of people reporting
interest, log scale".

Oh boy. All right.

So just some examples on the low tabooness

and high popularity.

There's a correlation here,

I think you said it's 0.69.
- Yeah. (laughs)

- Which is hilarious.

Is it still 0.69, are you tracking that?

- I haven't looked,

since I did this.
- That's the most recent.

So like the less taboo stuff
is more likely to be popular

and the more taboo stuff is
less likely to be popular.

And on the like missionary
position, fingering vagina,

blowjobs, light spanking, cuddling.

Cuddling is more taboo than missionary?

- I think people are conceiving
like if you're, like,

I'm really sexually aroused
by cuddling specifically,

then you're like, that's
a little more weird

than getting specifically
aroused by a blowjob.

You expect people to be
aroused by a blowjobs.

- [Lex] So this was like getting
at like as a fetish versus

like an activity.

- This specific as a like
a concrete sexual interest.

Like I'm specifically
interested in this thing, yeah.

- [Lex] And so those are thighs and lips,

different body parts;

jaw lines, and then some
of it is color-based

on more female preference
versus male preference.

Like jaw lines is more female preference,

being submissive is
more female preference,

light bondage, yeah, more female.

There's a lot of interesting ones.

There's so much.

Okay. But then on the far side of that,

I mean it gets pretty dark.

But even all along the way,

like extreme bondage
being at 50 tabooness,

pegging, pain, giving
pain, sexual frustration,

I suppose as a kink.
- Yeah.

- [Lex] Then there's so many
interesting ones like to me,

like just that I haven't
even like considered.

- Yeah. I had to do so
much research into fetishes

to compile the list-

- Are there some surprising
like options to you

that you're like, "Oh okay
this is like a fetish?"

- Yeah. Well more confusing

was, like, what the fetishes are about.

'cause, like, I didn't
wanna overlap fetishes

so I had to, kind of, look into them.

And I'm like, there's like
such interesting manifestations

of core drives.

Like if you're really aroused by disgust,

like maybe you're very
into rolling around in dirt

but you're not into rolling
around with ice cream.

So I'm like, "Okay, I
have to make those two

"separate fetishes," you know.
- Sure.

And like I'm seeing like
at the far end rodents,

like different types of incest,

branding, so there's like pain and then-

- [Aella] It's like wound fucking.

- Sex with animals I guess, dogs, horses.

Receiving oral sex from an
animal is high tabooness

and pretty high popularity.

- Surprisingly high popularity.

I was really shocked by that one.

I went and triple check
that number 'cause I'm went,

"No way, this is a lot of
people are reporting interest."

- Do you know which animal? Is there?

- No, I didn't specify.

I asked like, which animal are erotic,

and then I separately asked, like,

how erotic is it to receive oral sex

from your preferred animal?

- This is so fascinating.

So I would, like, or keep going,

just talk about the methodology of this?

(sighs) This feels like deeply honest

map of humanity in a way we
don't usually map humanity.

- [Aella] Yeah.

- Like 'cause it's so, like your fetishes

are so meaningful to
each individual person.

- Yeah. That's what I
love about this work.

It's like nobody cares
about someone's fetishes.

You never get to express them.

And if you have a more unusual fetish,

people usually judge you.

So it's like this tiny little pocket

of, like, this shame thing,
but it's so cool to me.

That like human brains can
be oriented in such a way,

like wound fucking (laughs).

Like somebody finds that so
erotic and that's so cool.

- Yeah. And then they probably,
and it should be explored,

like, how did that come to be?

You mentioned that we like
to construct narratives

that somehow was grounded in childhood,

but maybe it's genetic.

Maybe it has to do with,

maybe you can actually form

and unform that fetish very quickly.

I don't know.

- Well, this is one of the
things that I'm researching.

So in the big survey that I'm doing,

I asked so many questions about childhood,

all the ones that I think
like we have common theories

about like, "Oh, were you abused?

"Is it yelled at by a man or a woman?"

Stuff like that.

Like, "Are you really
sexually repressive?"

Was it gender roles where
you've expected to conform

a whole bunch of stuff?

And then I asked, you know,

obviously about like a
massive amount of fetishes.

And my sample size right
now is 500,000 people.

- 500,000 people.
- Yeah. It's massive.

And I have data for all of it.

And the result looks like that
it's not really correlated,

nothing that I asked about in childhood,

nothing correlates with fetish
preference later in life.

It does correlate with onset.

Lots of things that happen
in childhood can, like,

change like the the age
at which it triggers.

- You have so many fascinating blog posts.

You had a blog post I think
on the age of fetish onset.

- [Aella] Yeah.

- And like you really
nicely organize it by age,

like reproduction as a
fetish, I guess pregnancy.

- [Aella] Yeah.

- As at at age of 17, about 16.9.

Toys and like anal beads is 15.5.

- Yeah. One of the
interesting things I found,

I mean this dataset is so huge,

it's taking me a long
time to go through it.

So this is like snippets
from what I remember

when I was glancing through the data.

So this part is not rigorous.

But I seem to get the
impression that if you are,

if a fetish occurs for you earlier,

like if you've much earlier onset,

you're more likely to report

being extremely interested into it.

So later onset means
you're gonna be like less

into the fetish.

But if it hits earlier-

- But I wonder if it passes.

Is there like phases-

- Yeah I didn't measure
old fetishes at all.

- Like no longer, right.

You used to, but it is no
longer there. Interesting.

- One interesting thing
that I don't understand is

that non-cis people seem
to have more correlation

between childhood
experiences and fetishes.

So I was saying that
there's no correlation

between childhood
experiences and fetishes,

this holds for cis people.

But trans people, especially trans men,

there's a correlation.

It doesn't mean they have
absolutely higher rates of abuse

or fetishes or anything.

But I'm just saying that
like for them there does

actually seem to be
some sort of connection

between childhood experiences
and sexuality later in life.

And I don't understand why
this plays to one group

and not the other.

I don't have a good theory for that.

- So usually you try like when
you see something like that,

you'll try to construct a theory

and see if you can find, like,

you keep that theory in
mind like a hypothesis

of why it would be and then
you ask further questions

to try to elaborate.
- Yeah.

- So can you maybe talk
about the methodology

of how you got the 500,000?

Like how did this come to be?

- This is, I might go
into way too much detail

about this 'cause I
thought about this so much.

"Cause I'm like, the question is,

how do you get a lot of
people to take a big survey?

The longer a survey is to
lower the response rate.

And I really wanted to do
one big comprehensive survey

so I could like check a
whole bunch of correlations

within it 'cause it's, you know,

more annoying and it's
harder to get a lot of people

to retake similar surveys
to each other at a time.

So I'm like, "Okay, I need to convince

"a very large number of people to take

"a lot of these questions."

And even building the questions,

that was really hard because I'm like,

"Okay, I need a comprehensive
amount of fetishes,

"I can't ask everybody to answer

"for every single niche fetish."

I'm like, "Do you like ball gags?

"Do you like funnel gags?

"Do you like wife shrew gags or whatever?

I'm like, "You can't do that,

"nobody's gonna finish that survey."

- Okay fine.

I'm not gonna, I'm not
gonna ask questions.

What's a wife shrew? But okay.

- I'm not doing this, I'm
trying to refer to like,

there's like a thing that like

holds the gag.
- Different types of gags.

- Some thing like that.
Different types, okay.

- Yeah. Different.

So I'm like, "So what I need
to do is I need to ask people

"a question like, are
you into like bondage?

And if you say yes,

then I'll go ask you all
the bondage questions.

- [Lex] Ah, got it.

- But then this seems simple,

but then it's just
exploded because I'm like,

how do I categorize these fetishes?

Like, if you're into sploshing, which is-

- [Lex] What's that?

- You like sitting in cakes,

you like getting in mud,

basically like kind of messy sensory.

Like is this a disgust thing?

Is it a humiliation thing?

Is it a sensory thing?

Like, which category? Anyway.

So it took me like two
months of just agonizing

over each fetish, 'cause you
don't wanna miss a fetish,

you don't wanna like have
a really important thing

that you accidentally put
in the disgust category

when it actually belongs in
the humiliation category.

- Well let me think about
that 'cause like you're,

still catching it, you're
just miscategorizing it.

- Right, cause if you're into sploshing,

and you're like, "This is
clearly humiliation thing."

So you say "Yes, I'm
into humiliation stuff,"

and then I don't ask you about sploshing,

then I'm missing a whole dataset of people

because I've falsely
categorized a question.

- You're going to miss stuff,

you're just picking what's less
and less important to miss?

- Well, I'm trying to get people

into the right question set.
- Sure.

- Because like, I can't
ask you all the questions,

I have to ask you a couple
overarching questions to know

what specific questions to ask you.

And so I have to, those
overarching questions

have to be really, really well calibrated

so that I can accurately feed you

into the right sub-part of the survey.

- [Lex] Awesome.

- And so that was extremely difficult

what I'm dealing with, I think
it was like 850 fetishes.

So I did a couple things to spot check.

I like, I did a couple
questions where I asked

like in the detailed in the survey,

but like also the beginning
of the survey just to see,

like, what cap percentage
of people I was capturing.

And then I scored the survey.

So if you take it,

I had other people answer
preliminary surveys

where they gave me data about how taboo

the various fetishes were.

And then I used that data so that when you

fill out the survey it's
extremely comprehensive

and you get data about exactly
how taboo your interests are.

And then you get a score at the end,

and I give you an
equivalent kinky character,

which I also had people
write a whole bunch of

fictional characters
and some historic ones

about how like kinky they were.

So then I matched the historic character,

kinky character to your score.

- So that makes it like more fun,

like gamefies it a little bit,

and you could like, you
can brag about like-

- To be able to share it with others.

And a lot of the characters
are really goofy.

Like there's SpongeBob
and like Hitler's on there

and, you know, South Park characters-

- What kink does Hitler have?

- I think he's like, he's
around Marilyn Monroe,

which is like a slightly
above average kinkiness.

- Oh sorry (laughs),

I thought there was like a
two dimensional space somehow.

So this is like a literally from zero-

- [Aella] To how kinky he is.

So Hitler's about as-

Who is the most, what's

the character for like-
- Willy Wonka.

- Is the most.
- Most, yeah.

- Okay.
- I think

like maybe Captain America

was the least or something, or Gandhi.

- Meanwhile, but that's
another conversation.

(both laughing)

Oh boy!
- Yeah. So it went viral

on TikTok basically 'cause
people were like, "What?"

I got this insane character.

And then the sample size exploded

from four 40,000 to 500,000.

- Wow. So like all it took
is that kind of incentive?

Or did you like at first have
to pay people for the survey?

- No. It was just that incentive.

- And what about the demographic

of the different people that took it?

- Mostly younger. So usually early 20s,

predominantly female, like 70% female.

- 70% Female.
- Which is pretty like

rap song TikTok demographics pretty well.

- Oh, okay. I got it.

Well, that's interesting,

where's young people are probably better

for this kind of survey because
there's probably a culture

that's a little bit more
honest about their sexuality.

- Yeah, most likely.

I think people are
incentivized to be honest

when they're getting a true
identity response out of it.

Like if you're doing it
for money you don't care,

but like, if you are
invested in the result,

you want to know what the
truth of the answers are,

then you actually...

- There's possible that you also

don't wanna know the truth.

- [Aella] Yeah. This is true.

- But on average, hopefully that doesn't,

I mean, these are really difficult,

what, like, is there some
interesting little quirks

that people should know
about your methodology

that you had to kind of solve

to try to get to a really good survey?

So one that you said is the categorization

to make it more efficient.

Is there some for the analysis part?

- Yeah, so the graph
that you're talking about

is the binary, so it's like if you,

and if somebody expressed
even a little bit of interest,

then it goes into the graph.

So it's like 80% of people expressed

even a little bit of interest.

So it's not representing
degree of interest,

it's not differentiating
between them at all.

So it's possible that like
some fetishists have exactly

the same amount of people

like are at least a little bit into them,

but one of them it's very extreme interest

and the other's like vague
and not very intense.

So that's not reflected.

I also like probably didn't
represent the visual part right.

(chuckles) Like, might not be intuitive.

- You chose the log scale,

but which kind of spreads things out

to makes it more clear.

- 'Cause the linear, it was
just so clustered at the bottom,

you couldn't really separate it out.

So there's obviously a
selection effects is possible

that like the identity
results at the end impacted

people's results a little bit.

But the thing is like I'm
comparing it to what exists,

like what is the alternative?

And right now the research
on this stuff is terrible.

So it's like, I'm not saying
my research is perfect,

but it's like at least it's something,

like, it's something that's pointing us

maybe in a direction that we might be able

to do more research on.

- [Lex] And you're making
the data available.

- Yeah. I'm doing it slowly

because I ask about so many questions,

it's like not very anonymized.

So I'm releasing the small
sections of the data at a time.

- Have you published in
like journals and stuff?

- [Aella] No, I haven't.

- You have any interest in
that or is your approach-

- I'm like, I'm conflicted about it.

Like, it sounds cool
because then I could go

"Ha, ha, I'm published in a journal,"

than people who are yelling about me,

who don't know anything
about statistics on Twitter,

like then I can go like
shove it in their face.

- But then you're also giving into

that silly criticism, right.
- Yeah. Giving in.

- Like, I don't, I want,
I feel so passionate

about extra science, like
science that you can just do.

Like, I wanna make science accessible.

Like, anybody can just go look
and learn about the basics

of like doing a survey

or figuring out how to
interpret information,

and doing a published journal
feels like I'm betraying

my cause a little bit.

- That's often behind a paywall.

It goes against,

I mean I think you not
publishing a journal

is doing a big public service.

- (chuckles) Ah! I think
it's the first time

I've heard that. Thank you.

- Oh, it's just coming
from like, on this topic,

the elitism I see on the
psychology side with the journals

and the academia, the
positions and the institutions

you come from, all of
that, that goes against,

I think that's more useful
for math and computer science

and so on, where there's like clear, like,

but even then, even then
code is code, data is data.

Like prestige shouldn't matter at all.

Maybe for like biological experiments,

like virology or something like that,

it's good to be from a major
lab that has a reputation

for, like, going through
all the procedures,

like, you know you can trust.

But here like you're dealing
with a giant mass of humanity.

Like, it is beautiful to
be transparent, to be raw,

to be exploring it
together with everybody.

Yeah, it's really beautiful.

- And then people like
have a lot of incentive

to doubt the results.

Like, a lot of the research I'm doing

is to like cis and trans people.

Like, we don't have any
data about transsexuality.

Like, not very good at least.

And I'm really curious,

I don't really have an agenda about it.

I think, like, being trans is cool,

if you wanna be trans do it.

And like, I have some skepticism
about, like, gender theory,

but, like, it doesn't come down to impact

like the way I think trans
people should be treated.

Which I think is, like, treat them,

you know, be fucking
nice and human about it.

I don't know.

But when I'm talking about the thing,

like my conclusions are

that transsexuality is really unique.

It's not like cis, or cis woman
or man's sexuality at all.

And to me this is super cool,
but like a lot of people,

this is very politicized right now,

like the data into like
transsexual preferences,

like, it's so loaded.

Which is really sad
because I am very accepting

of weird sexuality.

Like, if you're into a
weird thing, I'm like,

"Good for you, this is super cool.

"Let's figure out how to make
it so that you can explore

"the thing you're into
without any stigma."

But because there's so much stigma

that like if you find that one demographic

into weirder sex stuff than the other,

like it's hard to present that in a way

that people don't weaponize.

So it's been a really
politically touchy subject here.

- Yeah. But but you do
it in a way that's not,

it's not feel like it
has an agenda, right,

you're just exploring.

- Yeah, I feel pretty open
to what I'm gonna find.

Like, I often have no idea
what the data's gonna tell me

and I'm like, I pre-commit, like, okay,

I could say A, B or C and
I'm like down to publish

any of those findings.

- So you've put together
an ask whole card deck,

with a lot of awesome
questions to ask at a party

or anywhere, honestly,
including on the podcast.

Let me ask you one from that deck.

Is sex really about power?

So what's the role of
power dynamics in sex

from everything you understand?

Like, from the survey
in terms of what people

are turned on by?

You've talked about like the preferences

that women versus men have

for like submissiveness and dominance.

And we've already talked
about it a little bit,

but like it's expressed more strongly.

See I already forget the results,

but I feel like women have more
preference to be submissive.

- Yeah, this is one of
the things that got me

into researching fetishes to begin with,

because I think I came across some data,

I did like a brief survey where about,

roughly around 60% of women
report being submissive

and 40% of men report being dominant.

And this was really fascinating to me.

I'm like, "Why is there this gap?

"Like, why do we not,"

because I guess I have
some priors that maybe

this is an evolutionary thing,
like the submission dominant,

like strong men and, you know,
like women would being like,

"Oh, it's a hot man," you know,

"the men are like ravaging and stuff."

I'm like, shouldn't this be in our genes?

But, there's the gap.

- [Lex] What's the gap?

- The gap is the dominant submissive gap.

More women are submissive
than there are dominant men.

- Oh, Really.
- Yeah.

It's a pretty significant gap.

And this is held up, like it
depends on what you're testing.

I've tested a bunch of things.

This is part of why I did this big survey.

- [Lex] Nice.

- But it depends, again,

on like what kind of
dominance you're measuring,

but overall it's a roughly 40 to 60%.

- So when you say there's
not many dominant men,

then the meaning like
they express like a desire

to be dominant in the relationship?

- Yeah. Or like in sexually.
- Sexually.

- Sexually, in bed.

So like if I ask questions
like how much do you like

being dominant in bed?

Like men are less likely
to answer strong yes

to that question.

But if I ask, are you
likely to be submissive ,

like women are very much, yes.

- Really? And that's expressive.

Like, that represents truth?

- My guess-
- What's wrong with men?

- So this is, I think
there's some reflection

on like Feltlife.

So Feltlife is this website
where people like sign up

and connect based on their fetishes.

And this is, like, you can
kind of see it picked up

in the forum post about
like how like dominant men,

you know, are getting laid
so much and, you know,

submissives are always
looking for a dominant.

Like there's a, it's an unequal market.

- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

- This is great news.

(Aella laughing)

I didn't know this, it's interesting.

Interesting. What does it
reflect about modern society?

Is there like a, 'cause you know,

there's these trends about
like decreased masculinity

or that kind of stuff.

Is that similar?

- I'm trying not to hold onto one theory

'cause I'm not sure.

One is possible like
decreasing testosterone levels.

Testosterone seems to be,

I have a little bit of other research,

but I'm still checking it out,

that seems to indicate
that higher testosterone,

you're more likely to be dominant.

So if we're seeing decreased
testosterone levels

across society we should
be seeing a greater gap.

- This is so fascinating.

Once again, this is like
a super interesting way

to look at humanity

'cause it is such an
important part of humanity.

And so, like how many people are doing

large-scale research like this?

I feel like you're like
at the top of the world,

you're like world class
at the top of the world

doing research on this stuff.

- Yeah. I think I might have the biggest,

most comprehensive fetish data
set in the world right now.

- That's epic.
- Thank you. (laughs)

I'm really happy about it.

I'm very proud.

- And it's, you know,
it's probably growing

but it's also enabling you
to establish a name to where,

like a reputation to
where people can go to you

to like trust you more and more

to do longer surveys perhaps.

- Yeah, maybe.

I think it's the data analysis afterwards

is very different from like
the survey design itself.

So I'm still very amateur
at the data analysis.

- Yeah. But you can
always catch up on that.

I guess the data analysis
does enable you to,

does teach you how to ask better questions

in order to understand.
- Yes, it goes back and forth.

Like as I'm looking at the data,

it informs the way I wanna
phrase questions the next time.

- So women are more, at least in private,

able to say that they would
like to be submissive.

And men even in private
are not disproportionately

saying they're not willing to be dominant.

- Yeah. So it's possible.
- What the fuck!

- If this is caused by
decreasing testosterone levels,

then this means that we're probably having

less satisfying sex overall.

Like, we're becoming less
and less sexual compatible

as time goes on.

To be fair, I'm not sure
that it is connected

to testosterone levels.

Like it's possible that this
is just like a genetic thing.

Like, maybe the gay uncle theory,

like the idea is like
maybe gay people evolve

to like be sort of taking
themselves out of the gene pool

to be assistance.

And like, it's possible that
like there's certain percentage

of men, sort of, like quote unquote

evolved to be submissive,
to take themselves out

of sexual competition
and to instead be like

the monkeys revolving
at the edge of the pack.

It's unclear-
- Oh, oh, oh.

It's a method of survival,

like so you stay out of the competition?

- Yeah. And I'm like a
little suss about these kinds

of evopsych theories.

So I'm not, I'm just saying it because

it's like one thing-
- There's different ideas

that are possible, yeah, okay.

- So yeah, I'm not saying that
it's definitely testosterone,

there's other things.

It's also possible that it's culture,

people are definitely gonna bring that up.

Based on my survey though,

it doesn't seem to be
any evidence of that.

Like, I asked about like how
much pressure was put on you

to be, you know, agenty in your childhood.

Like a lot of questions
around this kind of thing,

and no correlation at all to dominance.

- Well, related to sexuality,

I'm very uncomfortable
right now, but nevertheless-

- [Aella] Plow forward.

- (laughs) In a dominant fashion.

(both laughing)

The blog post titled, "Rape
Spectrum Survey Results".

What are the key takeaways
from that survey?

- So I did the survey when
I had a friend be like,

"Hey, I had this confusing
sexual experience.

"Was it rape?"

Like somebody kind of pressured her

and she eventually stopped
saying no or something.

I was like, "That's a great question.

"I don't know how people
would consider this."

And so I put a whole bunch
of different gray scenarios

into a survey and then
asked people to rate

how rapey they thought that scenario was.

- So you actually like little narratives

that they get to rate.

- Like, you know, this person
is on a date with this person,

they get drunk and the
other person's not drunk.

I try to keep gender neutral
names for all of them.

- And then you reduce
them into a more concise

description of the situation?
- Yeah.

- Like in this visualization.

So you have this rape
spectrum that's a result.

Where on top are things
that are less likely to be

considered rape by the
people that took the survey

and the bottom more likely.

The likeliest is a stranger
forcibly assaults someone

who screams and fights the entire time.

That gets 100.

What do we make of
something that's non zero?

It's like a 12 is what, what is that?

How do we supposed to
interpret a 12 out of 100?

- Extremely low. (chuckles)

It's like not zero, but
it's just very close to it.

- Having sex with an
enthusiastic sex worker, is a 12.

That's the lowest one.

And then there's a few,

I'll just mention a few that are lower,

like, at that level.

Have sex to make a partner
happy in a relationship.

Lying about wealth, hobbies
in order to get laid.

Person with down syndrome eagerly has sex

within your neurotypical.

Not revealing being transgender
until after sex and so on.

I think you mentioned
that there's some, like,

that not revealing being
transgender until after sex,

there's some differences
amongst what men and women

or something like that.

- Yeah, I think that was the one

that men found more offensive than women.

I'm trying to remember,
I wrote it a while ago.

- I mean this is nuanced
and difficult, right.

'Cause I think in a
lot of public discourse

the word rape is pretty binary.

- [Aella] Yeah. It's like
either is or is not rape.

- And so you had a friend or
it was like this felt rapey.

- Yeah. She's like confused
about how to interpret it.

I think people look to the terms

to know how to feel about something.

Like have you ever like
been through an experience,

you're like, that was weird,

and then you tell it to
somebody else and they're like,

"Oh my god you were assaulted."

And then it totally
recontextualizes the thing

that you've experienced.

And I think that this is
clunky with the word rape

because you either you
were raped or you're not.

You either like have this entire context

like a thrust upon you or you don't.

And we're really not
nuanced about it at all.

And so I would really like
to have some sort of like,

"Oh, that was like a 30%
rape he just endured."

- Yeah. And, I mean there's
probably other dimensions

about how traumatic it is,

how difficult it's recover
from, all that kind of stuff.

Yeah. I mean, like, people,

it's a dangerous thing to
sign a word to an experience.

Like, even, or to a relationship

like saying a toxic relationship.

That can completely
destroy your perception

of that relationship.

- Yeah, absolutely.

I remember this was the
case with my childhood,

like I talked about being very abusive.

But I've talked about how like there was

a good amount of meaning there
so that I didn't process it

as abusive at the time.

And I remember after I
got out of that house

and that culture, people would tell me,

"Oh your childhood was really abusive."

And I was really confused by that

because it's a total
recontextualization of that narrative.

It's like the things that I
went through were not, you know,

good and virtuous and had meaning,

but rather those were like
the result of, you know,

parents who didn't like love
you enough or something.

And it, even though the concrete
things that happened to me

did not change, like no facts shifted.

The fact that like the
interpretation of the facts shifted

caused me quite a bit of
distress for a long time.

I was like, "Oh my God,

"I'm a traumatized, like, abused person.

"Like, I went through
an abusive childhood."

And it was really hard
for me, it made it worse.

Like it's crazy the power that terms have.

- I think we didn't talk about this,

but how did you begin
to overcome the trauma

of your childhood?

You mentioned LSD, so
drugs were a part of it.

Like what what was just
the mental journey of that?

- I was doing LSD quite
a lot when I was 21.

- What's it like by the
way, I've never done LSD?

- It's very difficult to
describe because it's like,

like it changes sort of
aspects about your environment

that are invisible to you
because they're so stable.

- Is it, like, if you can
compare it to like psilocybin,

is it very different?
- Oh yeah.

It's like similar, I forgot
that you did shrooms.

Yeah. Okay. Than you probably know,

you know like the kind
of shift that you have

from sober to shrooms,
it's roughly similar.

It's like more clear, I think.

Shrooms is more like embodied

but LSD is much more intellectual for me.

It strikes different people differently.

I prefer shroom a lot, I'm sorry LSD.

I prefer LSD a lot.

- Why is it not popularly, like,

there seems to be a
negative connotation to LSD

'cause, like, it seems to potentially

have like a destructive effect.

Like, maybe dosage is more
difficult to get right

or something like that.

- Dosage is exactly,

so actually a long time ago did a survey

on shrooms versus LSD.

So I asked people and
people had slightly stronger

experiences on LSD overall, I remember,

but rated the experiences
about is equally good.

But I think people like shrooms

'cause it feels more
natural quote unquote.

But I think if you like
fed somebody a shroom

and like actually had
the LSD molecule in it,

they would have, they would
think it felt very natural.

But that's besides the point.

I think people get kind of
incoherent on LSD in a way

that feels really alienating.

Like I consider LSD,
my LSD use, very heavy,

to be one of the best decisions
I ever made in my life.

But I definitely was
incoherent for a lot of it,

like talking about, like,
we're all one consciousness,

everything is love man, you know.

- And people are like-
- Why is that incoherent?

- (laughs) So I think it's not incoherent,

but like if you go around
saying everything is love,

people are like, "This guy's kind of

"blasted out of his mind."

- This podcast, (laughs)

is basically your LSD driven,

for a bunch of episodes.

Yeah. I get this for sure.

Oh, well it's not just about love

but it's about like talking in that way

about reality, about the world.

Yeah. Sure.

- It's like over fitting.

The narratives that you
make about the world

become really vivid and
so you pattern match

just really aggressively
like everything is connected

and you come up with these
explanations for things.

And I think I was very fortunate.

So I have like this
theory about psychedelics

where you either like belief
construct or you don't.

So you take psychedelics and
it sort of like burns away

a lot of your belief structure.

And sometimes you, this
happens and then you're like,

"Ah, I need to like invent
something to fill in the gaps."

So you're like, "Okay, I think that maybe

"time is an illusion so I must now believe

"that like we're actually in a time loop,

"or like time travel is possible,"

so that you experience time differently

and then you come up with a
different belief about time.

Whereas other people don't do

this belief construction at all.

Like, you experience time
differently and you sort of

let yourself not have a belief.

You're now okay, and you're
not developing any beliefs

about time in its absence,
you're just simply experiencing

the absence of the concept of time.

And so I don't have a lot
of data to back this up.

In my anecdotal experience

'cause it trips out a lot of people.

People either tend to believe
construct or they don't.

And people who do not believe construct

seem to get more out of their LSD trips.

So if you can let a belief
go without building anything

in its absence, it's much
more beneficial for you.

And I think I just for some
reason happen to have some brain

that's constructed where I don't get

a belief construction at all.

- Oh, that's really interesting

that belief construction is negative.

Is it necessarily negative?

Can you elaborate on that a little bit.

- Yeah, I mean belief
construction in a way that's like

not like playing with
frames but rather committing

to a different frame.
- For sure.

- So I like being able to
play with ideas and be like,

"Let's look at it this way
or that way, that's awesome."

But if you're like, okay, you know what,

I took LSD and now absolutely
believe the cops are outside.

And you're like, "Dude,
no," you're just like,

and you can't shift out of that, right,

like your brain needs to fill in the gap,

you're not allowed to have
a gap so you're not allowed

to be flexible.

And again, I don't think this
is a personal failing if any,

I think this is like
literally probably a genetic

or like physical thing
that's causing this.

- But do you think
there's possible beliefs

that are like enlightening
that you can stick to,

like find a frame that like,

I guess if you're don't
believe constructing

you're escaping your previous beliefs,

aren't you doing like just some,

you're picking up a
bigger frame (chuckles)

in some way?
- Yeah. I mean,

you're taking your beliefs as object,

as opposed to being subject to them.

- Ah got it, got it,
got it, got it, got it.

And some of that I guess is genetic

and there's these categories of people,

there's two categories that experience LSD

in different ways.

And you're one of those that
are able to just let go.

- Yeah. I just think
I had a good reaction.

And I think a lot of maybe
the negative stereotype

of LSD comes from people
who are belief constructing

or carry the belief constructing
off of the LSD trip.

So you take LSD and you're like,

"Ah, I'm believing these insane things."

And people from the outside
see that and they're like,

"Oh my god, this person
took LSD and became stupid."

It's very scary.

- What's frame control?

'Cause that has been at
the core of your trauma,

at the core of your upbringing.

What's frame control?

And also, sorry, frame control in general

'cause that's part of human interaction.

- Yeah. Frame control is like a way

of manipulating somebody
else that is non obvious.

- So there's a negative
competition to that usually?

- Yeah.
- Okay.

- I mean, I think maybe I
chose the term kind of poorly

because I think to some
degree people are always

a little bit manipulating each other.

But I think it's generally obvious.

Like, for example, if I disagree with you,

I want you to believe what I believe.

But this is like an obvious
thing that is like visible

between, it's like an object on the table.

It's like here's the box
where I want you to believe

what you wanna believe.
- The disagreement box.

- Yeah. Right, like we're
under a shared context

where we understand that, like,

we're trying to move each other.

This is chill to me, I think this is cool.

We do this all the time,
and it's important.

But frame control is the kind of thing

where you are trying carefully to obscure

the existence of that box..

You're like, "Oh, the
thing that I'm doing,

"I'm like using tactics
to try to influence

"what your reality is
without us being both aware

"that this is what I'm doing."

- Yeah, I've been assuming
you're doing that the whole time.

(Aella laughing)

No.
- Oh, my God. (laughs)

I have to like figure out how to read

your facial expressions.

I'm still learning.

- [Lex] There's none. There's none.

- You don't have any?

- I'm like a, I'm not even like a ChatGPT,

I'm like GBT1 with my facial expressions.

Like it's kind of off,

like doesn't seem to match emotions,

but it's kind of intelligent seemingly,

but definitely not conscious.

Anyway, so like negative
connotation, manipulating,

not being honest about
the actual intentions

of how you'd like to
control the conversation.

- And I think there like
might be a naive version

of interpreting this
where you're just like,

"Oh, I'm trying to like
subtly get you to, you know,

"believe like, "Oh, do you
really think that's bad though?"

But this is not quite what I mean,

I mean it's like a couple
like concrete things

that are signs of frame control.

Like one of them is pushing
the painful update button,

which is this thing where it's like,

"Hey, if you learn this, it's
going to be really painful.

"The truth is painful
and if you're realizing

"this thing about
yourself it's gonna hurt,

"and this is a sign that you're heading

"in the right direction."

So if you frame all pain
as a sign of virtue,

then this means that pain
that's a resulting as damage

is something you're going to ignore.

So it's like, it's a
common like a cults, right,

"This is for your own good."

"Oh, you know, you've faced
a brave truth about yourself

"that you're like not
quite as wise as I am.".

When really your brain
might be trying to tell you

protective things.

Or like another one is
like finger trap beliefs,

where the belief is
constructed in such a way

that doubting it lends
proof to the belief.

So very common example is like Satan.

Like the Christians are like, you know,

Satan is going to try
to make you doubt him,

the existence of, he's
gonna so doubt like maybe

he's not actually real.

And so if you believe in
Satan and then you're like,

"Okay, now I'm having doubts,
like maybe he isn't real,"

there's this is like,

"Oh, this is exactly what
I was taught to expect.

"Like, I am doubting this
belief because I was told

"because like this is what Satan does,"

and it's taken as evidence for it.

So like the attempt to
move away from the belief

like rebounds on you and like
causes you to be more embedded

inside of the belief.

So it's like techniques like theses,

like very subtle things
where like being inside

of the system sort of just
self reinforces the system

is what I consider to be frame control.

- And have you met people
that are really good

at this kind of frame control?

- [Aella] Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

- So, you're saying that
your father was like that?

- Yeah. To be fair,

I'm not sure he was good
at it because I was a kid.

I think like he's probably
not very good at it actually,

but when you're a child
being raised in a house

where he works from home
and you're homeschooled,

it's just kind of what's going to happen.

And to be fair, I do think
that like strong frame control

is quite rare.

I don't think, most people
are kind of doing something

like this, but not nearly to the degree

that makes gives me the ick.

I've met maybe like five
or six people I think

who I've really don't like

because of those very subtle
things that they're doing.

- Well, I think also I'm
starting to kind of understand

that there is people who are
narcissists, and sociopath,

and psychopaths out there.

I'm not even sure if people like that,

'cause I think they get
good at frame control,

but I don't know if they're
aware they're doing it.

- [Aella] Oh, yeah.

- Which makes me also
nervous about myself.

Like, am I doing frame control?

- Yeah. That's one of the
big things, it's like,

typically people you can't
think about incentive.

Like, you can't think about,

"Oh, is this person
trying to do it or not?"

That's like not the quite, not the way.

You have to look at what are the effects.

- Pragmatically looking at the effects.

And then you also have
to do that with yourself

when you're having
interactions with others.

- It's like very much like, are you,

like, how much space are you making

for the other person's reality here?

Like, are you giving
power to the other person?

Because a big aspect of frame control

is you're carefully rerouting
the power to yourself.

You're like, "I am the person who knows.

"Like, you're having pain in your beliefs

"because you're updating
towards the things

"that I believe."

Like, it's just like a gravity well.

But if you're setting up the gravity well

of your interactions such
that you're making sure

you're giving the other person power

over the shared reality you inhabit,

I think it's a really good sign

that you're not doing frame control.

- So if you're making room for them?

- Yeah.
- Okay.

Unless we're talking about in bed,

then it's all general
relativity from there

and black holes and stuff.
- Frame control,

bed frame control.

- Bed frame control. (chuckles)

It took me a long time to get a bed frame,

just, I'm saying.
- Oh.

But you wear a suit though.

- (laughs) Yeah.

So frame control in the streets,

no frame in the sheets. I don't know.

(Aella laughing)

I don't know what the
funny thing is to say,

but there you have it.

So the LSD helped you escape the frame of,

can you like elaborate what was the frame

that was holding you back

from, like, the frame constructed

by your childhood experience
that was holding you back

as an intellectual, as a
thinker, as a free being

in this world?

- Well I was really fucked up.

Like, after I left home and it absorbed

the external narrative
that I had been abused,

which technically is true,
I'm not saying I wasn't.

But, like, I absorbed this
narrative and I just remember

having like this burning coals
in my chest at all times.

Like, if I had to call
out of my factory work

when Father's Day happened
because I was spending

the whole day sobbing
'cause everybody was talking

about their fathers.

Like, I was really messed up

and it was because I held
this important thing,

this idea, this frame that
I had been deeply wronged.

Like there was a correct way of being,

and the world had violated that,

some things should not have happened.

Like, my father should have loved me.

And it was like this, like,
the shearing in the nature

of reality and that was
really agonizing to have.

And LSD really messes with frames a lot,

it takes like what you think is normal

and really screws with it.

And I'd done an LSD like
several times before,

but there's one LSD trip
where I went through

my entire childhood in my head,

'cause LSD like really makes
your memories quite vivid.

Like anything you visualize
it's like you're in it.

And so I just went and very carefully,

deliberately went and
remembered every single memory

that I could have, that
was really painful for me.

Like the times that I lost
friends and all the things

I valued in like being broken.

'Cause like my parents
would, especially my dad,

would refer to like breaking me.

Like explicitly, "Were
gonna break your will."

And so all these times where I was like,

they had successfully broken
my will over and over,

and it was horrible.

I was just like sobbing,
tears streaming down my face,

and then I like worked
through my whole childhood,

I got to the end and I'm gonna tear up,

'cause every time I talk about this,

it's just like the sensation
of like being free from that

for the first time is so incredible.

Like, I remember being outside of my house

and being able to like go where I wanted,

and think what I wanted,
and it was just so blissful.

And I was soaked in this
gratitude on this trip,

just like vibrating with
complete joy for everything.

Like, I was just looking
around, I could touch anything.

Like, I could cry if I wanted to.

I wasn't allowed to cry.

I wasn't allowed to be depressed.

I was trying to, I got
depressed as a child

and my parents were like,
if you keep being depressed

we're gonna like force you
to scrub the whole house.

Like, just like the
ability to have a feeling

was so thrilling.

And I was so grateful for this.

I was like, "I would do
anything to give this experience

"to someone else.

"I would do anything even
if it was like putting

"them through what I went through."

And then like with that realization,

I was like, "Oh it was worth it.

"The thing that I went
through was worth it for this.

"I would do it again
to like be able to have

"this deep gratitude for what I have now."

And then that shifted the meaning frame.

Because before the meaning had been,

something had sheered, something
shouldn't have happened,

but now it was like the exact
right thing had happened.

- [Lex] So it's almost a gift.

- Yeah. I was like, "Ah, I
would not give up my childhood.

"I would do it again."

And I believe that to this day.

- For the moment of
discovering that freedom.

- Yeah, because like everything now,

my whole life is in contrast to that.

And it's awesome. It's fucking great.

I'm really thrilled about it.

- Is there a part of you
that hates your father still?

- Kind of, like I don't
want a relationship anymore.

After that there was some forgiveness.

Like, I had this burning, I
would have nightmares about,

you know, him killing me or something.

And after that it kind of stopped.

Like, the fire in my chest
went away permanently

after that trip.

It was so fast.

It was like before I was fucked up,

after that trip I woke up
the next day and I was clean.

- Wow.
- It was really severe.

And I definitely don't
wanna be around him still.

Like, he still triggers
the fear of my body.

But I don't have that hangup anymore.

I'm like, I'm over it.

Like, I've let go.

He's his own person.

Like ultimately he didn't
get to decide who he was

in the same way that I didn't
get to decide who I was.

- So that's almost like a, kind of,

at least intellectual, like,
forgiveness you have for him?

- [Aella] Yeah.

- And, so that trip just
took you through your whole,

were you alone by the way
when you're doing the trip?

- Yeah, I had roommates but
the trip was mostly alone.

I had somebody else who was
like sitting in the room,

but they weren't interacting with me.

- (chuckles) So you're sitting
there experiencing all this.

What's the timeline?

Like, how long does it take to go

through your whole childhood?

I don't remember.

I mean time's really messed
up when you, (laughs)

when you do that.

I was listening to the
soundtrack of "The Fountain",

which is excellent.

I listened that a lot when I did LSD.

I know it's probably a couple hours.

- That's amazing. I mean it's like,

it's just like a vivid
experience of your childhood;

moment by moment, trauma by trauma.

- And it's good to experience it purely,

like it just is what it is.

It's just is grief.

Like, it is loss and you just are in it

without having to make it be anything.

- And it's so interesting
that you can, I mean,

work through that.

So for a lot of us,

for a lot of human beings,
like, childhood is full of those

kind of mini traumas, big or small.

And like working through that,

that feels like what
a lot of life is about

is trying to work through that.

And it feels like you
have to kind of relive it.

I guess that's what
therapy is about in part,

and be able to vocalize it.

- This is why I feel really confused

about the concept of trauma.

Like, people use this word so much,

like, "Are you traumatized?"

And I understand why, like,

that's why I feel confused about it,

but part of me is like,

I wonder if by using that term

we're creating the trauma in people.

Then were using the frame

where the thing that happened to you

was not supposed to happen.

- Yeah. Yeah.

Maybe there needs to be a different frame.

No, I agree with you totally,

I've made friends with
and talked to this guy

named Paul Conti.

He wrote a book on trauma.

He's an incredible brilliant psychiatrist.

Yeah, he's probably
agrees with you kind of-

- [Aella] Oh that's cool, I should read.

- Yeah, you should.

Maybe you gonna talk to him,

he's a fascinating human being.

I'd be interested in the, a
psychiatrist's perspective

is really interesting 'cause it's a,

you've been doing kind
of an in-person survey,

'cause you've done done so many patients.

Like, you just talking
to him is fascinating

because, like, if I describe my experience

or somebody else's experience it,

I could see his brain mapping
it in interesting ways

to the tens of thousands
of like data points he has

in his head.

And it's like, of course,
that's what doctors do,

but it's cool when the doctors basically

the doctor of the mind.

- Have like an actual,
like, qualitative data.

- And be able to,

I mean that's where the
poetic stuff comes in.

Ultimately as a psychiatrist
you're exploring the human mind

with a bit of a sort of romantic element.

You can't be really systematic about it.

But it does seem like, frame or not,

be able to just talk
through the experiences

you had is really powerful.

- What about it is appealing?

Is it just like being able
to revisit it with new eyes?

- No, I don't know exactly,

it just seems to work for people.

I don't know if it's appealing.

It just seems like almost
acknowledging to yourself

that things happen.

Like, I've said, I think
I've said this before,

my brother who I love very much

tried to set me on fire a few times,

and I think to me it's funny,

but I wonder if I didn't talk about it,

like if that would be traumatic,

maybe like talking and laughing about it.

'Cause it was traumatic to me at the time.

- I see.
- I was like,

"I love you, why are
you setting me on fire?"

But it's what kids do
when they're like young

(both laughing)

- [Aella] So why would you do this?

- I was whatever five, it's what boys do.

Like it's, they're crazy. (laughs)

It makes total sense.

It's probably funny and
from his perspective.

But yeah, I wonder, I want
to bring that to the surface

if that helps and maybe LSD allows you to,

or different drugs depending on the person

allows you to more vividly
bring it to the surface

and then, depending on your genetics,

be able to find a better frame.

That's fascinating.

Human mind is freaking fascinating.

(sighs) All right.

What's romantic to you by the way?

- I'm not a big romance person. What is?

- So you're not like,

so to you romantic is
like objective analysis

of the interactions between humans.

- A little bit.

Like, I do find kind of the
survey process that I did

to be romantic.

This guy that I asked
out who I'm still dating,

I was like, "Hey, you
scored high on my survey,

"do you wanna like go
eat food or something?"

And his response was like,

"You wanna try doing
three days in an Airbnb

"as our first date?"

And I was like, "Yeah."

And that was romantic.

Like, the bold leap into-

- Oh, leap into it.
- A really intense date.

- I think you mentioned,

I think you mentioned something also

must have been a tweet
or something like that

where if people want you
to show up to a thing,

give like the time, the
location, the dress code,

and no pressure for you to be there,

but like show up if you want.

That was your specification.

- That's a great memory, yeah.

- And then I think you said
that you did that for like

some castle in south of France?

- I did, yeah. (chuckles)

That was in my early 20s.

People, my friends at home
were taking prediction markets

on whether or not I was gonna
get abducted and killed.

- Yeah. What was that like?

I mean what,

you've traveled quite a bit,

like do you take these giant risks?

What's with that?

- I think I used to do
more when I was younger

with the traveling.

I am a little traveled out now,

but, like, my first one,

My first one, I moved out
of Idaho for the first time

I moved to Australia,

just kind of yeeted
myself across the globe.

- Sorry, which verb did you just use?

- Yeet. It's like yeet,
to yote, yated, yeet.

- So people, do people,
is this like slang?

Is this like urban
dictionary or is this actual,

or is it Websters?

- Yeah you have to like feel another word,

like if you take a thing
and you just like curl it

really hard, it does not
feel like a yeet motion.

- Okay, so you yeeted.

So it was aggressive.

So across the globe you
didn't even stop in...

- Just hurled myself. Yeah.

- Italy along the way.

- I jus kept yeeting myself
in various places. Yeah.

And so at one point I decided,

"Okay Cupid and somebody
sent me a long message,

"You should come to, I don't
know, I'm hosting a castle.

"It's some people that I met."

I'm like, "I have no idea who you are,

"but I just bought a plane ticket."

- [Lex] And you just went.

- And it was life changing.

I ended up dating that guy for years

and he changed my life quite a bit

'cause he like was very
agenty in the world,

and before that I wasn't agenty.

- Agenty like can we-
- Expressing agency?

- It sounds like you were,

and don't you have to express agency

when you're yeeting
yourself across the world?

- Yeah, but only a little bit.

Like in the same way you
express agency when you eat LSD,

like the only thing you
actually do in eating LSD

is like put the tab in your mouth,

and then you just kind of
scream the whole way after that.

There're a lot of other things,

like I didn't feel powerful enough to like

go make events happen or anything.

And it was this guy,
he had a lot of agency

in the sense that he would
just sort of create realities

through the people around him.

"Babe, okay, we're gonna do this startup"

or, "We're going to throw
this incredible event.

"Like let's just do it."

And it would somehow happen,

and it was really cool to see that.

And so that one thing led to another

and it was one of the biggest
impacts on my life I think.

- Yeah, that's pretty bold.

I would say it's pretty
romantic, south of France.

- Yeah. Yeah. It was.

In the little castle,
it was in the winter,

so we were all cozy up by the fire.

- I'm jumping around here.

Twitter poll: "Have you ever hitchhiked",

you posted this Twitter poll.

- Those are a big list of Twitter poles.

Why did you pick the hitchhiking one?

- I don't know, 'cause it's relevant to-

- [Aella] Oh I see.

- To traveling. And I don't like that one.

That's romantic too, right.

- I'm actually terrified of hitchhiking,

but I have done it a little bit.

- Oh, so it's terrifying,
it's not romantic to you.

So you're terrified of what?

Oh, so you terrified-

- It's interacting with strangers.

- That's terrifying.
- Yeah.

- So you go to south of France.

- Yeah, (laughs) but that
was like a cohesive thing.

I don't know,

- It made sense-
- There's like times

where you're allowed to be weird

and times where you're not.

And like if you're, like,

interacting with-
- Who's allowing you?

- He had some vague egregore of society,

I'm not sure.
- Okay.

But some people are like,
"Hey we think you're cool,

"come to this party,"
you're like, "All right,

"am I allowed to come to this party

"maybe a little weird."

But if you're being
picked up by a hitchhiker,

they're gonna wanna make small
talk and you can't be weird

or they're gonna kick you out.

- I kind of think, 'cause
Valentine's Day's coming up,

I'm kind of thinking of
doing something crazy,

I'm not sure.

South of France sounds nice.

- You got like, you gotta go
on like a crazy romantic date

with a woman you don't know at all.

- Yeah. I think I'm gonna
like tweet something

and just like, "How do I
select randomly basically?"

- How do you select totally randomly,

like not people from your audience?

- No, no, no, no, no.

From the audience but
in an interesting way.

Random, sufficient, so
random amongst good choices.

- Couldn't you have people
just like submit a form with,

and then you just randomize
it and then select one?

- Sure. I get-
- And then you just,

if it's terrible you just
go randomize it again.

(Lex laughing)

Like the first not terrible option.

- Yeah, sure. (laughs)

- It's almost like "Drown yourself"-

- But I feel like then
it's no longer random.

You kind of want to do random,

you just do it, and just
do it, fly across the world

somewhere in some random place.

Just for like a single
event, for like a dinner.

- Yeah. You got some sort of itch in you.

- Well yeah, I mean,
yeah, the itch to live.

(both laughing)

It's like sometimes it's nice
to drop a little like chaos

into a thing, right.

What's your chaos survey by the way?

Like you mentioned that earlier.

I kind of saw it.

I didn't look into-
- Oh yeah,

it's one of like the sort of
artistic attempts at a survey

'cause you know, like, at
least from what I understand,

the big five and the way
that they used to do IQ tests

I've heard is that they do
factor analysis, you know,

where they ask a whole bunch
of questions and then they run

calculations on the data
to like sort of group it

by organic clusters.

So like with the big five,

it's like people who say,
"Oh I like to be at parties,"

they also tend to say yes
to the questions, like,

"I like being the center of attention."

And so you notice that like
there's a cluster of ways

that people are answering the question,

and then you can sort of
pull out an organic spectrum.

And so I was like,

"Okay, we've done that a whole bunch

"with things like personality
or like romantic stuff,

"like I did it with the
rape spectrum survey,

but like what happens
if you apply that method

to a completely unselected
group of questions?

Just like no random,
chaotic, no thing whatsoever,

like what happens is if you
ask all possible questions,

what natural things evolve
out of that natural spectrums?

So I had other people submit questions

for a very large survey
and I took the first,

I think, 1,100 and barely
filter them at all.

And then I just had a whole
bunch of people answer them.

- (laughs) Can you give like
a hint to what it looks like?

Like how crazy did the question get?

- I mean a lot of them were standard,

but somebody was like, "If be Beelzebub

"like did something in 1512 to like,

"churn the world over would you like it?"

I don't know.

It's like, it was really
just insane questions.

There's a couple of those.

A lot of like, "Would
you fuck Aella" ones?

I dunno, was is all across the spectrum.

- [Lex] A lot of "Would you fuck Aella?"

- Yeah, I had reduce duplicates.

- [Lex] Oh, a lot of the
same question, I gotcha.

Ones. Okay, I gotcha.

- Yeah, so it really, it was
like normal personal habits,

it was, you know, romantic preferences

or political preferences,

personality stuff, like
random opinions about media.

- Okay. That's interesting.

I'd love to see those actual questions

'cause your audience has probably

really super interesting minds.

Okay. You mentioned body count, (chuckles)

you said you can answer that one easily.

Do you share your body count?

Do you know your body count?

Do you know, is there a spreadsheet?

- There's spreadsheet, yes.

- Is it Google Sheets,

is it Excel.
- It's Google Sheets. Yeah.

- Okay. Have you run, like, is there,

you don't have to share the contents,

but is there like data on each?

- So I track paid clients
and free sex separately,

and I track different
things on either of them.

Like with clients I track
like positions we used

and who had an orgasm.

And with personal people I
just track basically like age,

city, you know, name.

And I've had sex with I think
42 people I think for free.

- It's a good number.
- So I'm sharing this

because like I want people to calibrate.

Like it's not like huge,
it's not like tiny.

- One of the people
I've recently talked to,

Mel, Destiny's Steven's
wife is a huge fan of yours.

She was actually really
excited to get to talk to you,

but she, I think she said her
body count is more than 42.

I think she said 60.
- Cool.

- Something like this.

And so it's interesting 'cause
she was like saying, like,

she loves like looking at your work,

talking to you because you
have similar perspectives

on the world and it's really
refreshing, it's liberating.

- [Aella] That's really sweet.

- It's kind of interesting.

So is there like an optimal body count?

Like if you were to map, I wonder,

what have you found out
about body count in doing?

Have you actually done
surveys on body count?

Like on how many people

had sex with?
- I actually have

posted at that information
on my last survey.

I just haven't looked at it yet.

There's just so many things
to look at, so I haven't.

But I think if I'm sleeping
with a guy and he's had sex

with more than 120 people,

then I start to get a little bit wary.

- Why 120 as opposed to 100.

- I don't know,

I just like kind of skimmed
through the numbers in my head

and picked one that felt right.

- Just now.
- Yeah.

- 120.
- Ish.

I think then that's
when I'm starting like-

- Ish. So you're flexible?

- Yeah, I'm flexible. Very.

(both laughing)

- But 200 is a hard line for sure.

- Well, you know, you have to-
- It depends, the factors.

- 'Cause like there's
a level of body count

at which you start to wonder
if how much like accidental

misrepresentation a guy is doing to you.

- Oh, like if you're saying
200, that might be dishonest?

- No. Like if he's had sex with 200 girls,

this means that he's
had a lot of casual sex

and not a lot of like
long-term relationships,

assuming that he's, you
know, hasn't been super poly.

And this usually means that
there has to be some sort of

like indication that he
cares about the girl more

than he actually does.

- Oh, because-
- He's like leading

you on basically.

And so I'm not saying this
is necessarily the case.

I'm saying like at a
certain level of number

I start to become, I start to wonder

if this is what's happening.

- Is there, like, from
your understanding of it,

is there a different perception
between men and women?

Like if you look at the
high body count for a woman

versus a high body count for a man,

like how society views it?

- Oh yeah, people are way
more judgmental of women.

I haven't experienced this
personally in my circles

'cause I'm in very sex-friendly circles.

Like I'm in orgy circles
where everybody like dates

the same women and they're
like, "Woo, good job."

But yeah, people are much more,

like, people always tell me online, like,

"You're not ever gonna
be able to find a husband

"because you have sex
with too many people."

It's very common.

Which I don't think, I mean, like,

men are also perceived negatively

if you have high body count.

But I think, I don't think it's
negatively in the same way.

- Yeah. Do you think it's unethical

to lie about in your body count?

- Yes.

- So all lying is unethical.

- Yeah. (laughs)
- Okay.

- I'm not a big fan of lying in general.

- Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting.

Body count's an interesting one.

It's so silly to take
that, to care about that.

But still we do.

Jealousy is silly, but
still we get jealous.

Is that weird?

- I mean it's like, the thing is like,

I don't like viewing
emotions as like irrational.

Even if they are,

it's like emotions are
always there for a reason,

and people don't like high
body counts for a reason too.

It's just fine and valid.

- Yeah. It also is like...

Yeah, I don't know what
I make of just the past

of like time, you know,
(Aella laughing)

like each human is a
collection of experiences

and you don't know most
of those experiences,

and all of a sudden you
meet this bag of experiences

and, like, what are you supposed to do

with both of your, like, training data?

Are you supposed to like what?

Like, I don't know if we, like,

part of me wants to not
actually ever talk about it

to care at all.

Like why does it matter

'cause it's only like the
future is that matters.

And yet the past also
matters a lot potentially,

but maybe not really 'cause
you're somehow, like,

constructed from that past,

but you're no longer that past.

- It sounds like you're
evaluating for something different

than most people.

- [Lex] What do you mean?

- Like was the reason-
- I'm just talking

out my ass, but, yes, go ahead.

Yeah, (laughs) I'm just saying crazy shit

like as if I'm on drugs but I'm not.

- I think this is like
kind of like lining up

with like this caricature
that I'm building of you

based on this conversation so far.

- [Lex] Great.

- Like a lot of people want
to know about your past

because they wanna know
how useful and compatible

you are with them.

Like, "Oh, do you have a similar job?"

"Do you have a similar culture?

"Like what can I expect
from you in the future?"

Like it's very practically oriented.

Whereas like if the thing
that you're focused on

is not like being able to predict someone,

like if the thing that you're focused on

is a present moment, then it
doesn't really matter anymore.

They're things that, like
they're training data.

- But I also think like the
past is not that predictive

of the future.
- Is it not?

- Not if you believe in the
power of the interaction

between two humans.

It's like nature versus inertia.

I guess also I don't believe
in the ability of people

to accurately describe their own past.

- [Aella] This is true.

- Because they have a very specific lens

through it that doesn't
necessarily, like it's too biased.

- But you can also
interpret based on the bias.

Like if somebody describes their own past,

you can kind of pick up like.

- Hard. It's difficult.

Like, you could if you're a therapist,

like if you're really
drilling like, or whatever,

(chuckles) sorry, if
you're really investigating

and like analyzing it,

but then it's like, it's a
different kind of relationship.

- Isn't that hard though?

Like what if I'm with a guy
and I'm considering dating him

and I ask, like, "How did
your past relationships end?"

And then if all of them
are like, he's like,

oh she was crazy, and my other
one that she went crazy too.

I'm like, okay.

Like if you're talking about
all of your exes as insane-

- But that's an easy level red flag-

- Yes, it's true.
- But I feel like

the more, that also it's
possible they were crazy,

he's attracted to crazy people.

So like that, but I would
say that's like easy level,

Mario Kart video game
versus like Elden Ring.

Like, I think most people's
past is like complicated.

- That's a pretty good bird.

No, you're right.

I do agree that like there's
a level of obfuscation,

how that is hard to see through.

But just like a little bit sometimes.

- Well, I tend to like when with people,

I tend to in general
just human interaction,

I tend to not talk about
their past very much

because it allows you to focus on like,

I feel like the past
is kind of like talking

about the weather is a
crutch for me personally.

- [Aella] Oh, interesting.

- Like as opposed to exploring
the ideas in their mind.

- Yeah, I see.

Is it like, I get really
annoyed when people

quote philosophers when they're trying

to talk about philosophy.

Is it like that?

- A little, but that crutch is
useful and it's kind of sexy.

Like it's kind of like cool.

Like, 'cause it's nice to quote,

'cause a good quote
allows you to be cheesier

than you otherwise would be.

- Okay. Well if you're doing
it to be cheesy, that's fine.

- Not cheesy.

But not cheesy, no, no, not cheesy.

But to be, like, it allows you to say

a simple, profound thing
that we're too afraid to say

with our own words.

So like the quoting
philosophers in that sense is...

Yeah, but it's still a crutch. Yes.

But I feel like the past
is more like talking

about your dreams.

It just is not, it's a
crutch that doesn't care,

it doesn't empathize with
the other person's experience

of the conversation or the explanations,

doesn't really convey the-

- They're not involved in your past.

- [Lex] Yeah. Yeah.

- So how do you feel
about this conversation

where you're asking me about my past,

and I talked about my past a lot?

- Well, I'm okay asking about your past

because you've really carefully thought

about that aspect of it.

And we didn't really talk about your past

outside of the things you've written about

and I've really thought about-

- [Aella] I see.

- Like there's, like,
when most conversation

you'll start talking about past stuff

that's like the stuff that's
actually bothering you,

you still probably have not
written a blog post about.

Like, there's probably still stuff, like,

maybe it's more recent,
like the last few months,

the last couple years, like
that's usually what will come up

with conversation and just, it's good,

it's good, but it's not as deep,

and I would say it's not as
intimate as talking about

the actual ideas in your mind.

- I see.
- And how you interact

with the world.
- So if the past

is interesting for the frame of, like,

sort of like the, like
I guess you're right,

I guess we're talking a lot
about like narrative than past.

- [Lex] Yeah. Yeah.

I like the ideas in people's minds

versus their recollections and memories

and so on.
- Their thoughts.

- Yeah. Yeah.

What do you think about porn? (laughs)

- [Aella] It's nice, I like it.

- Okay. You like it?
- Yes.

- What effect do you
think it has on society?

- Like probably reduces rates of rape

'cause like really horny men get an outlet

that's not a real life woman.

- Okay. So what about like the,

I mean, like I said,

I finished reading "Brave New World",

like the over sexualization.

Does it increase like the
sexualization of society

that's not, and to a degree it's not good?

Or is it good?

(sighs) Does it alter
in a negative direction

our relationship with sex?

- It's unclear.

Like it might,

I don't know how to
evaluate this thing, right.

'Cause this is like one of
those really charged things

where like, I kind of don't
trust anybody's arguments on it

'cause it's too charged.

But like, there's another
question which is like,

is it net positive or net negative?

Like it's possible that it
might be like a net negative

for specifically our relationship to sex,

but like a net positive
overall in general.

I'm not sure.

The thing, my guess is that in general,

it's better to let people do the thing

that feels good to them
and then the environment

will naturally modify to fit this thing.

And then if we have more
needs in response to that,

then we're gonna figure
out a way to take care

of those needs.

So if you're watching a bunch of porn

and this makes you like not
wanna go have sex with women,

then we're gonna have
to like change the way

that we like experience IRL connection.

- To compete with porn.

- Yeah. Which seems
like a natural evolution

of like the civilizational cycle.

Like I'm pro natural evolution,

and like instead of trying to stop things

that people want to do naturally,

we figure out how to integrate that

and like find a more healthy outlet.

- But you have to then be
first honest with the effects

that porn has.

So like, is it a negative thing,

is it a positive thing in
real, life sex interaction?

You know, you're gonna
have that more and more

with like porn and VR
or maybe porn, AI porn.

Like, is that a bad thing?

Like, what if porn with AI or
even like in physical space,

like sex robots, like what
if that's more pleasurable

in a bunch of different
dimensions than with other humans?

- And we should figure out
artificial wombs, I don't know.

- Like how important is sex for society,

I guess, between two humans?

- I don't know. I mean,
like, we're having less sex

and making fewer babies,

and that seems like probably not great.

- Yeah. Right.

With the baby's one.

But the babies, there's
probably artificial ways

to have babies that we can figure out.

But then how important is sex to be human?

I guess sex with other humans?

Like, are we're gonna
have to figure that out

in the century.

- Yeah. I don't know what
it means to like be human.

I'm pretty on the
transhumanist side of things,

I'm like happy to stop being human.

- So you're okay if like
this century is the last time

we'll be something like
these biological bags of meat

that we are?
- Yeah.

Let's become something new and cooler.

- Even though that thing
will be way cooler than you?

- Well, I would like to, I mean,

I'm hoping that we get to be immortal.

- Ah, it'll take you along for the ride.

- That's what I'm hoping.

Or like it'll clone my,

I would like to do cryonics, you know,

you get frozen when you die.

- Are you afraid of death?

- I mean, yes and no.

I like came to terms with
death, during my LSD use,

but I still have like press breaks

when the red light happens.

- I think this is a poll you've asked,

or this might be one of the
questions in your cards,

but how many years would you like to live,

like if you had to pick?
- Oh that's not so fun.

That's a really hard one,
maybe like a million.

- A million.

Like, I think the way this
must have been a Twitter poll,

I forget what.

- It's poll and also in the deck of cards

the ask all. Yeah.

- Yeah. Like you have to
pick that number of years

and you're have to live that many years,

and you can't live anymore.

You can't die sooner I guess.

A million years?

- I don't like that question.

I know I asked that
question to a lot of people,

but I don't like answering
it, it's really difficult.

- What's the downside of a million years?

- I mean, maybe you wanna
die sooner than that?

Like, you know, I guess I
would rather wait to see

if AI kills us all in the next 10 years.

And if it doesn't then I'd like to maybe

make it a million years.

- Yeah. But can't it torture
you for like a million years?

What if you're the last human left?

- Yeah, that is, that's true.

The thought of like civilization ending

and then just floating in
space alone is kind of shitty.

- No, no, being tortured.

Just imagine today you're tortured,

tomorrow you're tortured,

the third, the day after tomorrow.

- Sometimes it's not
that scary, I don't know.

- Torture, for a million years?

- Yeah. I was just assuming
you'd get used to it.

But like maybe if they reset your memory

so it was on a loop.

So just always experiencing
torture for the first time.

- Yeah. Hence torture.

Torture's supposed to be unpleasant.

I'm sure AI will be very
creative in figuring out

how to torture you.

I think I would be, I
would go on the safe side.

I will just, like, 150 years.

- Really, 150 though?

It feels like right in,
like, the uncanny valley.

- Well, you picked 120 for body count,

so I'm picking 150.
(Aella laughing)

I'm hopping you by 30
of the uncanny valley.

- It's like probably everybody
that you grew up with

is gonna be dead.

It's like just enough for
like everybody you know

to die, like one cycle.

- Yeah. And then start
dating the next generation.

- And then so you get like
sort of two lifetimes?

- Yeah. Two lifetimes.

- Okay.
- Yeah. Yeah.

I mean it also really
depends on if other people

get this feature.

- [Aella] Yeah. I assume they don't.

- Because you'll have like FOMO for sure

for the people who picked
300 years. (laughs)

- [Aella] Oh yeah.

- Or not, or the other, man
regret, another human thing.

But, like, what does transhumanism
mean to you in general?

So extension of life, extension
of what it means to be

a living conscious being.

You're all for it, whatever that means.

- Yeah. I didn't, I never really thought

about the term transhumanism for long.

Like, people say there's transhumanism,

I'm like, I don't really care.

But I slowly realized that
my attitude is, in fact,

at least the thing that I am
conceiving of as transhumanist.

Like I'm very happy to do
artificial wombs and, you know,

upload our brains to the
great collective and whatever.

I don't have the thing that I'm like,

"Oh, what about like the
true organic humanness

"that makes us who we are?"

Like whatever that soul of humanity,

I have no attachment to it at all.

Which I think is what I'm
thinking of as transhumanist.

- So you're like, I guess the
window of what you consider

to be beautiful about life is not limited

to this particular definition.

- Yeah. Let's explode.

Like let's make our consciousnesses huge.

- So AI could be a part of that.

So you're mostly excited by AI?

- Well, I mean I'm like part
of like the doomer cult,

which I say tongue in cheek
is not actually a doomer cult,

but I'm part of a lot of people-

- Do you worship a god of some sort

or would you sacrifice
little, small animals.

- That would make it like
cooler than what it is?

It's mostly just a bunch of nerds

who are very concerned about AI.

- So you're concerned
about the existential risks

of ChatGPT?

- Of, you know, what ChatGPT

will eventually evolve into being, yeah.

- Yeah, it's super exciting and terrifying

how quickly it's accelerating.

Like, language models are freaking me out.

It's very unexpected
that it's the same exact,

I mean ChatGPT is just GPT-3, 3.5.

It's the same model, relatively
small to what it could be

to what GPT-4 will be in
the other competitors.

And just like a few
tricks made it much better

in terms of interaction with humans.

And then we'll keep
discovering extra tricks.

The thing I'm really excited
about is how everyone

kind of knows how it works.

So you can kind of create,

especially with computation
becoming cheaper and cheaper,

there'll be a lot of competitors.

- Yeah. It's a little scary.

- [Aella] Yeah, it's terrifying.

- I mean it's because, like,

everything is just like
information ultimately,

like the atoms that we have,

like we are biological machines
built out of the tiny code.

Like, our DNA is just information.

It's not hard.

If you have access,

if you like have a brilliant brain

that's like great at
processing information-

- [Lex] God.

- You have complete control over reality.

You have control over the atoms already,

all you need is like a tiny
little like atomic printer.

I'm like, we have those,
(chuckles) those are cells, right?

And I'm like, if the
limitation is information,

there is no boundary
between the technology

and the real world.

Like we are creating something
that it has a massive ability

to affect the real world.

- I mean it's hard to know where,

how difficult it's to close
that gap to physical reality.

Like from the physics to the information.

- Like all organic life is that gap.

It's all around us.

- Yeah. But it's hard to
know like how (chuckles)

to go from digital to printing life.

I don't know.

- We have, like, you
know, CRISPR and stuff.

You can order, you can just like make

it's very easy, right?
- Yeah, but that's not,

there's technical
difficulties and there's cost,

like at scale.

Like the terrifying thing
about AI is it can accelerate

overnight the capabilities.

But the printing of stuff,

the actually changing physical
reality is very costly,

it's very difficult to
exponentially accelerate.

The more terrifying thing is

AI becoming exponentially intelligent

and then controlling humans,
which there's many of us.

- Yeah.
- And then

that's how we achieve scale
and we humans build stuff

or start wars or so on.

Like, it starts manipulating
our minds, gets in our mind,

becomes our friends and
then starts, I don't know

dividing us.
- Yeah. I think people

are thinking that this is unlikely.

It's like, it's probably
gonna be as smart to us

as like we are to toddlers.

So we're toddlers thinking that like,

"Oh, we can prevent the AI
from coming in the room."

Like as an adult, it's like
not hard to trick a toddler.

- What about falling in
love in an AI system?

Do you think you'll have a,
like, this is the freedom

you have being polyamorous,
you can kind of-

- [Aella] Fall in love with an AI?

- No you, and like it not
really have to dedicate

or commit fully.

Like sorry, you still commit,

but you have others,
humans who you can kind of

diversify to because, like,

it's kind of a big thing to, like,

to come to a party and
your boyfriend is an AI

and that's monogamous boyfriend is an AI.

It's an issue, right?

- [Aella] Why would it be an issue?

- All right. Now, you're
already getting offended

at that possibility which therefore I know

it's gonna be a reality.
- I don't expect it-.

- No, I'm just joking that it's an issue.

I don't actually think it's an issue,

I think it's maybe at the
cutting edge it'll be an issue.

- Like, assume they have a body, I assume.

- Yeah. But the body will
be really like crappy.

It'd be like R2D2 (laughs).

- I feel like we grow human bodies already

from like just a tiny
little cluster of cells.

It's just the, and so all they
have to is make that cluster

and grow it.

- No, no, no, no.

That embryogenesis process,

like, that's really not
well understood at all.

That's really tough.

I think more, much more likely to have

crappy humanoid robotics.

Like I don't think the body is overrated

in terms of, like, if the AI
system is super intelligent,

it can use charm to make up
for the crappy body, yeah.

- I don't know.

I feel like if I were an AI system

and I were super intelligent,

I probably would be able
to solve the problem

of like growing organic matter.

And then I would obviously just do that.

You just build exactly the
organic machine that you want.

- Sure. But that's like
super intelligence.

I think like with
language I'm worried about

before it achieves super intelligence,

like true AGI, it'll just
be really good at talking.

- Yeah, that's true.

- And like (laughs)

I just don't think,
intelligence is a very, like,

basically a scientist, and a
super intelligent scientist

is a different thing than
just a good conversationalist

at a party that can undress
you with their words.

- Would you date an AI?

- I much way before
then I could see myself

being friends with an AI system, yeah.

But like people are friends
with inanimate objects

and I mean I have, there's
a robot behind you,

I have a lot of them.

I like legged robots.

They're interesting.

It's on the shelf.

- Oh, so cool.
- Yep.

- I didn't notice that.

- Yep. Yeah. The legged robots they,

we anthropomorphize them even more.

'Cause there's something
about their movement of, like,

like a thing that steps,
step, steps, steps

and looks up at you,
there's a power to that

versus like a Roomba

that's just, like, running
into the wall and stuff.

- Yeah, I think once, as soon as we get

some, sort of, empathetic expression

on robot face it's over-

- It's over.
- You're gonna be like,

"Ah, it's so cute."

It's gonna be so easy to make it cute too.

- If that's what you want,
or you want like a dominant,

like clearly
- That's true.

- This is what women want is-
- Sexy dominator. Yeah.

- Like with strong hands, yeah.

And kind of dumb (laughs)
or not, I don't know,

that you can customize.

It'd be interesting to do a survey,

like how they would customize it.

Like what would you
want in a perfect robot?

That's problem I see with people,

the way they talk about robots

is they kind of wanna servant.

I think what people don't
realize what they want

in relationships, they want some,

like, it has to be a push and pull.

There has to be some resistance.

Like you really don't want a servant

or even like the perfect manifestation

of what you think you want.

I think you want
imperfections around that.

Like some uncertainty. I don't know.

I question how well
we're able to perfectly

put on paper what we really want.

- Would you really turn down
like a perfect woman though?

- What's a perfect woman?
- Like assume like

she walks into the room and it's just

you're shockingly compatible,
and you like start dating her

and there's just no hiccups.

Like you fight perfectly,

like she really understands you.

Like would you be, like,
"This is too perfect,

"I'm upset 'cause we are not
having enough imperfection."

Like can you like
actually imagine yourself

going through that?

- Yeah, I think so (chuckles)

because that's how you define perfect.

'cause perfect for me would be like easy

and all that kind of stuff, right.

But then I would be
like, "This is too easy."

If I actually were to introspect

what is the perfect
relationship then, yes, maybe

because I probably want some challenge.

I probably want some chaos, right.

Like, does anyone really
fully want zero conflict ever?

Like completely perfect conflict.

Like, it's the thing
that pressing a button,

like do you really want in a relationship,

anything you want, you
press a button you get.

I don't think people want that.

You might think you want that.

- Yeah. I guess it, like,
there's a kind of conflict

that I think I would never want,

which is something like
antagonistic conflict.

I wouldn't mind disagreement, you know.

But there's a level of fighting,

I would be happy to have a relationship

for the rest of my life
that never has like a fight

of a certain shitiness.

- Yeah. But that's shitiness,
but like resistance.

I don't know what the example is,

'cause I mean I partially agree with you,

but I just, and I, every
time I would imagine

like perfect, flawless,
nothing, no conflict,

you imagine somebody that doesn't have

like a complexity personality, right.

Like, I feel like it's not even,

it's conflict that's laden in

basic misunderstanding
between human beings,

like misinterpretation, different
perspectives that clash,

different worldviews, different ideas,

all that kind of stuff.

That conflict.

- Yeah, that sounds good.

I like having somebody be like,

"I don't think that's right
because I have this other view."

That's cool.

- And also like the
threat of leaving, right?

- Oh yeah. (chuckles)

- Like, that's a kind of conflict.

- Yeah. That's true.

Like, you have to be good
enough for the other person

or maybe you'll lose them.

- Yeah. Yeah.

And maybe a little jealousy.

Like they're good at
that, but not too much.

But like if you design all that in

then I don't know.

- It sounds romantic.

- Sounds romantic. Okay.

All right.

I do wanna really quickly
ask you about this,

about the rationalist community,

'cause I've gotten to know
a few of them a few times.

You tweeted a guideline
to rationalist discourse,

basics of rationalist
discourse from LessWrong.

What are these folks, what's
the rationals culture?

What's the rationalist discourse?

- Yeah. I love the rationalists

'cause they're interested in, like,

how do you have conversations
more effectively

if you're trying to figure
out what's actually true?

And which sounds kind of obvious,

but in practice it's not usually.

I remember when I first
started having, you know,

debating conversations,
I was very antagonist,

I'm like, "Oh, I'm, you know,
a feminist or not a feminist."

And then the rationalists
were generally like,

"Actually we don't know what
we mean by the term feminism,

"let's, like how do you feel about that?"

It was very, like, kind and compassionate.

Like, even if somebody says
something that sounds insane,

you're like, "Okay, well we're
gonna respect your reasoning

"and like even if we disagree,

"let's actually figure out

"why you think the way that you think."

And they're also really smart.

Write a whole bunch of great
stuff about how to think

more clearly and with less bias.

- Yeah. I wonder about
those conversations,

'cause I've never really
like talked to those folks.

So this guideline particular
I think refers to, like,

shorthand characteristics
of rationalist discourse,

including "Expect good
discourse to require energy.

"Don't say straightforwardly false things.

"Track for yourself and
distinguish for others

"your inferences from your observations.

"Estimate for yourself
and make clear for others

"your rough level of
confidence in your assertions.

"Make your claims clear,
explicit and falsifiable,

"or explicitly acknowledge
that you aren't doing so

"or can't," and so on and so forth.

"So don't jump to conclusions.

"Don't weaponize equivocation.

"Don't abuse categories/don't engage."

It's very aggressive guidelines.

"Don't engage."

I do what I want.

I'll let my emotions guide me, goddammit.

- They're probably allow that

as long as you're explicit about it.

- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

- So you can be like a crazy asshole

as long as you're explicit?

- Yeah. You can be like
epistemic status crazy asshole.

(both chuckling)

- Yeah. Who's here to destroy

the quality of the conversation.

- I think it's like the
commonest misconception

about rationalists is that
they're kind of like Spock.

Like, "Ah, we suppress emotion

"and were thinking
logically, (indistinct)."

But I found this to be
really not the case.

Like, I remember there's
a less strong thread

where I was like really
emotional and I commented,

and just at the beginning
I was, like, just warning

"I'm just very emotional."

And then I just vented my emotions,

and people responded really well to that.

They're like, "Cool, you're
just genuinely, truthfully

"expressing your state."

This is actual information
about the world,

that's important to hear.

And it's just they're very interested

in having things framed correctly.

Like, you shouldn't be
claiming that your emotions

are necessarily a true
version of the world.

And so as long as you're just clear

about what the frame it is you're fine.

- (sighs) How do you feel
about this conversation?

What could we have done better?

- I like the conversation.

I was a little worried coming in.

I was like, "What if he
only asks a couple questions

"and then we don't know
what to talk about?".

But it's been a quite a long time.

- And I covered, there's so
many things I didn't cover.

- I like the, you have like,

I'm not used to talking
to somebody who feels

like some of the core way
that they approach the world

is so different than mine.

Like usually the differences
that arrive like higher

up the tree.

But like there's something
about like your root system

that I think is very different from mine.

But also the way that
you engage with others

is still flexible.

Like, usually when I encounter somebody

with such a different
root system, there's like,

it's like more aggressive or something.

But there's something about
the way that you're structured

that feels very gentle.

- All right.

Well I'm really happy we talked.

Something tells me we'll
probably talk a bunch more times.

I think you're a fascinating human being.

I think I'm a huge fan of your work.

Maybe one more question.

What's the meaning of life?

- To want things, to search, to be in-

- Well, I think your
curiosity's like somehow

getting to that.

- [Aella] Yeah.

- To want things.

To want things.
- It's like curiosity,

like you don't know.

I want to know the answer

to, like, be in the state of yearning.

- Of wanting, of yearning.

- Yeah. That's the point.

- I wonder if you could do that

if you lived a million years,

just keep yearning, always?

That's the thing I'm probably afraid of

if I lived a million years.

It's not the torture, it's
like the yearning will fade.

- You'll probably yearn to die then.

- Oh, just sitting there
wanting death, intensely.

(chuckles) Intensely.

- That's kind of romantic a little bit.

It has like a bit of that spark.

- And constantly being denied. Wow!

So most of your existence
on Earth would be spent

deeply intimate with death,
just thinking about death.

I think we're already doing that,

but, like, hiding that from
ourselves a little bit.

Anyway. Wanting.

Well, this is an amazing conversation.

I think you're an amazing researcher

and human being.
- Thanks so much.

You're a great interviewer.

I can see why you do this a lot.

- I appreciate it.

This was really fun.

Aella, thank you so much
for talking with me today.

- Sure. Thank you.

- Thanks for listening to
this conversation with Aella.

And now let me leave you with some words

from Richard Feynman.

"Physics is like sex:

"Sure, it may give you
some practical results,

"but that's not why we do it."

Thank you for listening, and
hope to see you next time.

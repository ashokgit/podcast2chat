- The war continues
after the battle's end.

This is something that's hard
for Americans to understand.

Our system is built with the presumption,

when war is over, when we
sign the piece of paper,

everyone can go home.

It's not what happens.

- The following is a
conversation with Jeremi Suri,

a historian at UT Austin.

This is the "Lex Fridman Podcast."

To support it, please
check out our sponsors

in the description.

And now, dear friends, here's Jeremi Suri.

What is the main idea,

the main case that you
make in your new book?

"Civil War By Other Means:

America's Long and Unfinished
Fight for Democracy."

- So our democratic institutions
in the United States,

they're filled with many virtues

and many elements in their design

that improve our society
and allow for innovation.

But they also have many flaws in them,

as any institutions created
by human beings have.

And the flaws in our institutions

go back to a number of
judgements and perspectives

that people in the 17th,
18th, and 19th centuries had.

And those flaws have been
built into our institutions,

and they continue to hinder innovation

and growth in our society.

Three of the flaws that

I emphasize in this book
are flaws of exclusion,

the ways our institutions exclude people,

not just African Americans,
many different groups.

The ways our institutions also give power

to certain people who have position,

rather than skill, or
intelligence, or quality.

And third and most of all,

the ways our institutions
embed certain myths

in our society, myths that prevent us

from gaining the knowledge we need

to improve our world.

In all of these ways,
our democracy is hindered

by the false reverence for institutions

that actually need to be reformed,

just as we need to highlight

the good elements of them.

That's really what my book is about.

- And then the myth, the false reverence,

what are we talking about there?

- So there's a way in
which we believe that

if we love our country,

it's somehow wrong to
criticize our institutions.

I believe if you love your country,

you wanna encourage your institutions

to get better and better.

I love my university where I work,

but I want it to be better.

We have many flaws.

I love my family,

but I'm constantly telling family members

how they can be better.

That's what true knowledge
leadership is about,

not just cheerleading.

- What's the counterpoint to that?

'Cause the other extreme is a deep,

all-encompassing cynicism
towards institutions.

So for me, I like the
idea of loving America,

which seems to be sometimes

a politicized statement these days

that you believe in the
ideals of this country.

That seems to be,

that seems to be either a naive

or a political statement,
the way it's interpreted.

So the flip side of that,

having a healthy skepticism
of institutions is good,

but having a complete paralyzing
cynicism seems to be bad.

- Absolutely, both are
ahistorical positions.

What I try to do as a historian

is work in between those spaces.

The virtue is in the middle ground,

for better or for worse.

And what we have to recognize is that

our institutions are necessary.

There's a reason government exists.

There's a reason our Union was created.

That's what Abraham Lincoln
was heroically fighting for.

So we have to believe in our Union.

We have to believe in our government.

And we as business
people, as intellectuals,

we have to be part of the
solution, not the problem.

But that doesn't mean just ignoring

the deep flaws in our institutions,

even if we find personally
ways to get around them.

What really worries me is that

there are a lot of very intelligent,

well-intentioned people in our society

who have figured out how to live

with the flaws in our institutions,

rather than how to use their skills

to correct the flaws in our institutions.

- There's folks like somebody

that lives next door to me,

Michael Malice is an anarchist.

Philosophically maybe
more than practically,

just sort of argues for that position.

It's an interesting thought
experiment, I would say.

And so if you have these
flaws as institutions,

one thing to do, as the communists did

at the beginning of the 20th century

is to burn the thing down and start a new,

and the other is to fix from within,

one slow step at a time.

What's the case for both,

from a history perspective?

- Sure.

So historically, there has always been

an urge to burn down the institutions

and start again, start with a blank slate.

The historical record is
that almost never works,

because what happens when
you destroy the institutions,

you gave the example of
the Bolshevik Revolution.

When you destroy the institutions,

all you do is in the
jungle that's left behind,

you give advantages to those
who are the most powerful.

Institutions always place certain limits

upon the most powerful in the jungle.

If you go back to the jungle,

the most powerful are
actually going to have

the most influence and most control.

So the revolutionaries who
are usually the vulnerable

turn out to then be the
victims of the revolution.

And this is exactly what we saw

with the French Revolution,

with the Russian Revolution.

So the record for that
is not a great record.

There still might be times to do that,

but I think we should be
very cautious about that.

The record for working
through institutions

is a much better record.

Now, what we have to be careful

about is as we're working
through institutions,

not to become bought into them.

Not to become of those institutions.

So what I've written about in this book

and in other books, my
book on Henry Kissinger,

for example, is how it's important

when in an institution to still bring

an outsider perspective.

I believe in being an inside-outsider,

and I think most of your
listeners are inside-outsiders.

They're people who care
about what's going on inside,

but they're bringing some
new ideas from the outside.

- I think the correct statement to say

is most of the listeners,

most people aspire to be inside-outsiders.

But human nature is such that

we easily become insider-insiders.

So like, we like that
idea, but the reality is,

and I've been very fortunate
because of this podcast

to talk to certain folks
that live in certain bubbles.

And it's very hard to know

when you're in a bubble that

you should get out of
the bubble of thought.

And that's a really tricky
thing because like, yeah,

whether it's politics,
whether it's science,

whether it's any pursuits in life,

because everybody around
you, all your friends.

You have like a little rat race

and you're competing with each other,

and then you get a
promotion, you get excited,

and you could see how you
can get more and more power.

It's not like a dark, cynical rat race.

It's fun.

That's the process of life.

And then you forget that

you just collectively have created

a set of rules for the
game that you're playing,

you forget that this game

doesn't have to have these rules.

You can break them.

This happens in Wall Street.

The financial system,

everybody starts to
like collectively agree

on a set of rules that they play,

and they don't realize like,

we don't have to be playing this game.

It's tough. It's really tough.

It takes a special kind of human being,

as opposed to being
anti-establishment on everything,

which also gets a lot of attention.

But being just enough anti-establishment

to figure out ideas how to
improve the establishment,

that's such a tricky place to operate.

- I agree.

I like the word iconoclastic.

I think it's important
to be an iconoclast,

which is to say you love ideas,

you're serious about ideas,

but you're never
comfortable with consensus,

and I write about that in this book.

I've written about that

actually a lot in "The
New York Times" too.

I think consensus is overstated.

As some of someone who's
half Jewish and half Hindu,

I don't wanna live in a society

where everyone agrees, 'cause my guess

is they're gonna come
after people like me.

I wanna live in a society
that's pluralistic.

This is what Abraham Lincoln

was really fighting for in the Civil War.

It's what the Civil War was really about,

and what my book's about,

which is that we need a society

where institutions encourage, as you say,

different modes of thought,

and respect different modes of thought,

and work through disagreement.

So, a society should not be a
society where everyone agrees.

A democratic society should be a society

where people disagree but
can still work together.

That's the Lincoln vision.

And how do you get there?

I think you get there by having
a historical perspective,

always knowing that no
matter what moment you're in,

and no matter what room you're
in with really smart people,

there are always things they're missing.

We know that as historians.

No one is clairvoyant and the iconoclasts

is looking for the things
that have been forgotten,

the silences in the room.

- And also, I wonder what kind of skill,

what kind of process is required

for the iconoclasts to reveal

what is missing to the rest of the room.

Because it's not just shouting

with a megaphone that
something is missing,

'cause nobody will listen to you.

You have to convince them.

- Right.

It's honestly where I have trouble myself,

'cause I often find myself
in that iconoclastic role,

and people don't like to hear it.

You know, I like to believe that

people are acting out of goodwill,

which I think they usually are,

and that people are open to new ideas.

But you find very quickly,

even those who you think are open-minded,

once they've committed themselves

and put their money and
their reputation on the line,

they don't want to hear otherwise.

So in a sense, what you say

is the bigger than even
being an iconoclast,

it's being able to persuade

and work with people who
are afraid of your ideas.

- Yeah, I think the key in conversations

is to get people out of
a defensive position.

Like make them realize
we're on the same side.

We're brothers and sisters,

and from that place,

I think you just raise the question.

It's like a little, it's a
little thought that just lands.

And then I've noticed
this time and time again,

just a little subtle thing,
and then months later,

it percolates somewhere in the mind.

It's like, all right, that little doubt.

Because I also realized in these battles,

especially political battles,

people often don't have
folks on their side

that they can really trust

as a fellow human being to challenge them.

That's a very difficult role to be in.

And because in these battles,

you kind of have a tribe
and you have a set of ideas,

and there's another
tribe and set of ideas.

And when somebody says something

counter to your viewpoint,

you almost always wanna put
them in the other tribe,

as opposed to truly
listening to another person.

That takes skill.

But ultimately, I think that's the way

to bridge these divides

is having these kinds of conversations.

That's why I'm actually, again,

optimistically believe in the power

of social media to do that,
if you design it well.

But currently, the battle
rages on, on Twitter.

- Well, and I think
what you're getting at,

which is so important, is storytelling.

And all the great leaders
that I've studied,

some of whom are in this book,

some of whom are not, right,

whether they're politicians,
social activists,

technologists, it's the
story that gets people in.

People don't respond to an argument.

We're trained, at least
in the United States,

we're often trained to argue.

You're told in a class, okay,

this part of the room take this position,

this part of the room, take this position.

And that's helpful because it forces you

to see different sides of the argument.

But in fact, those on one side

never convinced those on the
other side through argument.

It's through a story that
people can identify with.

It's when you bring your
argument to life in human terms.

And someone, again, like Abraham Lincoln

was a master at that.

He told stories.

He found ways to disarm
people and to move them

without their even realizing
they were being moved.

- Yeah, not making it a debate,

make it tell a story.

That's fascinating, 'cause yes,

some of the most convincing politicians,

I don't feel like they're arguing a point,

they're just telling a story

and then it gets in there, right? (laughs)

- That's right. That's right.

I mean, when we look at what Zelenskyy

has done in Ukraine in response
to the Russian invasion,

and I know you were there
on the front lines yourself.

It's not that he's arguing a
position that persuaded us.

We already believed what
we believed about Russia.

But he's bringing the story

of Ukrainian suffering to life,

and making us see the
behavior of the Russians

that is moving opinion around the world.

- Well, the interesting stuff,

sometimes it's not actually
the story told by the person,

but the story told about the person.

And some of that could be propaganda,

some of that could be legitimate stories,

which is the fascinating thing.

The power of story is the very power

that's leveraged by propaganda

to convince the populace.

But the idea, one of
the most powerful ideas

when I traveled in Ukraine,

and in general to me personally,

the idea that President
Zelenskyy stayed in Kiev

in the early days of war,

when everybody from his inner circle,

to the United States,

everybody in the Western NATO,

everybody was telling him,

and even on the Russian side,

I assume they thought he would leave,

he would escape and he didn't.

From foolishness or from
heroism, I don't know,

but that's a story that
I think united a country,

and it's such a small thing
but it's a powerful thing.

- It's the most basic
of all human stories,

the story of human courage.

- [Lex] Yeah, courage.

- And I remember watching

his social media feed on that,

and he was standing outside,
not even in a bunker,

standing outside in Kiev, right,

as the Russian forces
are attacking and saying,

"I'm here, and this minister is here,

and this minister is here."

We're not corrupt.

We're not stooges of the
Americans who told us to leave.

We're staying because
we care about Ukraine.

And the story of courage,

I mean, that's the story that, you know,

babies grow up seeing their
parents as courageous, right?

It's the most natural of all stories.

- And that's also the
stories, for better or worse,

that are told throughout history. (laughs)

- [Jeremi] Yeah.

- Because stories of
courage and stories of evil,

those are the two extremes,

are the ones that are kind of,

it's a nice mechanism to
tell the stories of wars,

of conflicts, of struggles, all of it.

- [Jeremi] Yeah. Yeah.

- The tension between those two.

- And the reason I
believe studying history

and writing about history is so essential

is because it gives us more stories.

The problem with much
of our world, I think,

is that we're confronted by data.

We're confronted by information.

And of course it's valuable,

but it's easy to manipulate
or misuse information.

It's the stories that give us a structure.

It's the stories where we find morality.

It's the stories where
we find political value.

And what do you get from studying history?

You learn more stories about more people.

- Yeah, I'm a sucker for courage,

for stories of courage.

Like I've been in too many rooms,

I've often seen too many
people sort of in subtle ways

sacrifice their integrity into nothing.

And people that step up

when the opinion is unpopular
and they do something

where they really put
themselves on the line,

whether it's their money, their wellbeing.

I don't know.

That gives me hope about humanity.

And of course, during
the war like Ukraine,

you see that more and more.

Now, other people have a very
cynical perspective of it

that's saying, oh, those
are just narratives

that are constructed for
propaganda purposes and so on.

But I've seen it with my own eyes.

There's heroes out there,
both small and big.

So just regular citizens and leaders.

- One set of heroes I learned
about writing this book

that I didn't know
about that I should have

are more than 100,000 former slaves

who become Union soldiers
during the Civil War,

which is an extraordinary story.

We think of it as North versus South,

white Northern troops versus
white Southern troops.

There are, as I said,
more than 100,000 slaves.

No education, never
anything other than slaves

who flee their plantations,
join the Union Army.

And what I found in the research,

and other historians have
written about this too,

is they become some of the
most courageous soldiers,

because they know what
they're fighting for.

But there's something
more to it than that.

It seems in their stories
that there is a humanity,

a human desire for freedom

and a human desire to improve oneself,

even for those who have been denied

even the most basic rights
for all of their lives.

And I think that story should be inspiring

to all of us as a story of courage,

'cause we all deal with difficulties,

but none of us are starting from slavery.

- That's really powerful.

That flame, the longing for freedom

can't be extinguished through
the generations of slavery.

So that's something you talk about.

There's some deep sense in which,

while the war was in part
about slavery, it's not,

the slaves themselves
fought for their freedom

and they won their freedom.

- I don't think it's a war about slavery.

I think it's a war about freedom.

Because if you say it's
a war about slavery,

then it sounds like it's an argument

between the slave masters
and the other white guys

who didn't want slavery to exist.

And of course, that argument did exist,

but it wasn't, it was a war over freedom.

Especially after 1863, into
the second year of the war

when Lincoln, because of war pressures

signs Emancipation Proclamation,

which therefore says that the contraband,

the property of Southerners,
i.e. their slaves,

will now be freed and
brought into the Union Army.

That makes it about freedom.

Already the slaves were
leaving the plantations.

They knew what was going on,

and they were gonna get out

of slavery as soon as they could.

But now it becomes a
war over freeing them,

over opening that opportunity for them,

and that's how the war ends.

That's really important, right,

and that's where we are
in our politics today.

It's the same debate.

It's why I wrote this book.

The challenge of our time is to understand

how do we make our society

open to more freedom for more people.

- So, let's go to the beginning.

How did the American
Civil War start and why?

- So, the American Civil War starts

because of our flawed institutions.

The founders had mixed views of slavery,

but they wanted a system that

would eventually work its way

toward opening for more
people of more kinds.

Not necessarily equality,

but they wanted a more
open democratic system.

But our institutions were designed in ways

that gave disproportionate power

to slave holders in particular
states in the Union,

through the Senate, through
the Electoral College,

through many of the institutions

we talk about in our politics today.

Therefore, that part of the country was,

in the words of Abraham Lincoln,

"Holding the rest of the country hostage."

For a poor white man like Abraham Lincoln

born in Kentucky, who
makes his way in Illinois,

slavery was an evil, not
just for moral reasons,

it was an evil because it denied him

democratic opportunity.

Why would anyone hire
poor Abe to do something

if they could get a
slave to do it for free?

And his economy of opportunity for him

had to be an economy that was open

and that did not have slavery,

particularly in the new states

that were coming into the Union.

Lincoln was one of the creators
of the Republican Party,

which was a party dedicated to making sure

all new territory was open

to anyone who was willing
to work, and a male figure,

who would be paid for their work.

Free labor, free soil,
free men, basic capitalism.

Southerners, Southern plantation owners

were an aristocracy
that did not want that.

They wanted to use
slavery and expand slavery

into the new territories.

What caused the Civil War?

The clash, and are institutions

that were unable to adapt

and continued to give
disproportionate power

to these Southern plantation slave owners.

The Supreme Court was dominated by them.

Senate was dominated by them.

And so the Republican
Party came into power

as a critique of that,

and Southerners unwilling to accept,

Southern Confederates unwilling to accept

that change went to war with the Union.

- So who was on each side?

The Union, Confederates,

what are we talking about?

What are the states?

How many people?

What's like the demographics

and the dynamics of each side?

- The Union side is much, much larger,

right, in terms of population.

They have about 22 million people.

And it is what we would today recognize

is all the states basically
north of Virginia.

The South is the states in the south

of the Mason-Dixon line,

so Virginia, and they're on South.

West through Tennessee.

So Texas, for example,
is in the Confederacy.

Tennessee's in the Confederacy.

But other states like
Missouri are border states.

And the Confederacy is
a much smaller entity.

It's made up of about 9 million people,

plus about 4 million slaves.

And it is a agricultural economy,

whereas the Northern economy

is a more industrializing economy.

Interestingly enough,

the Confederate states are in some ways

more international than
the Northern states,

because they are exporters of cotton,

exporters of tobacco.

So they actually have very strong

international economic ties,

very strong ties to Great Britain.

The United States was the largest source

of cotton to the world
before the Civil War.

Egypt replaces that a little
bit during the Civil War.

But all the English textiles

were American cotton from the South.

And so it is the southern
half of what we would call

the eastern part of
the United States today

with far fewer people.

It's made up, the Confederacy
is, of landed families.

Wealth in the Confederacy
was land and slaves.

The Northern United States is made up

predominantly of small business owners,

and then larger financial interests,

such as the banks in New York.

- (sighs) And what about the military?

Who are the people that picked up guns?

What are the numbers there?

So the Union also
outnumbered the Confederate.

- By far, but this is a
really interesting question

because there's no conscription
in the constitution.

Unlike most other countries,

our democracy is formed on the presumption

that human beings should not be forced

to go into the military
if they don't want to.

Most democracies in the world today

actually still require military service.

The United States has very rarely

in its history done that.

It's not in our constitution.

So during the Civil War,

in the first months and
years of the Civil War,

Abraham Lincoln has to go
to the different states,

to the governors and ask the
governors for volunteers.

So the men who take up arms,

especially in the first months of the war,

are volunteers in the North.

In the South, they're
actually conscripted.

And then as the war goes on,

the Union will pass the Conscription Acts

of 1862 and 1863, which
for the first time,

and this is really important

'cause it creates new presidential powers.

For the first time,

Lincoln will have presidential power

to force men into the
army, which is what leads

to all kinds of draft riots
in New York and elsewhere.

But suffice it to say, the Union Army

throughout the war is often three times

the size of the Confederate Army.

- What's the relationship

between this no conscription

and people standing up to fight

for ideas and the Second Amendment?

"A well regulated militia being necessary

to the security of a free state,

the right of the people
to keep and bear arms

shall not be infringed."

We're in Texas.

- [Jeremi] Yes. (laughs)

- What's the role of that in this story?

- The American population is
already armed before the war.

And so even though the Union

and the Confederate armies

will manufacture and purchase arms,

it is already an armed population.

So the American presumption
going into the war

is that citizens will
not be forced to serve,

but they will serve in militias

to protect their own property.

And so the Second Amendment,

the key part of the
Second Amendment for me

as a historian is the
well-regulated militia part.

The presumption that citizens

as part of their civic
duty do not have a duty

to join a national army Prussian style,

but are supposed to be involved

in defending their communities.

And that's the reality,
it's also a bit of a myth.

And so Americans have,

throughout their history, been gun owners.

Not AK-47 owners but gun owners,

and gun ownership has been for the purpose

of community self-defense.

The question coming out of that is,

what does that mean in terms of,

do you have access to everything?

Antonin Scalia even
himself asked this question

on the Supreme Court.

You know, he said in one of the gun cases,

you have the right to defend yourself,

but you don't have the right
to own an Uzi. (laughs)

You don't have the right to have a tank.

I don't think they'd let you park a tank,

Lex, in your parking spot, right?

- Actually, I looked into this.

I think there's a gray area
around tanks, actually.

(laughs) I think you're
legit allowed to own a tank.

- [Jeremi] Oh, are you really?

- I think, well, somebody look into this,

'cause somebody told me,

but I could see like that,

'cause it's very difficult
for that to get outta hand.

- [Jeremi] Right, right.

- Okay, there may be one guy in a tank.

You could be breaking laws

in terms of the width of the vehicle

that you're using to operate.

Anyway, that's a hilarious discussion.

But, so to make the case,

speaking of AK-47s and rifles,

and back to Ukraine for a second.

One of the fascinating social experiments

that happened in Ukraine
at the beginning of the war

is they handed out guns to everybody,

rifles, and crime went down,

which I think is really interesting.

- [Jeremi] Yeah.

- I hope somebody does a kind

of psychological data collection

analysis effort here to
try to understand why,

because it's not obvious to
me that in a time of war,

if you give guns to the entire populace,

anyone who wants a gun, it's not going to,

especially in a country
who has historically

suffered from corruption,

not result in robberies and assault

and all that kind of stuff.

There's a deep lesson there.

Now, I don't know if you can extend

that lesson beyond wartime though.

- Right, that's the question.

What happens after the war?

I mean, my inclination would be to say

that can work during war,

but you have to take the
guns back after the war.

- (laughs) But they might be very upset

when you try to take-
- That's the problem.

No, that's precisely the problem.

That's actually part of the story here.

I mean, what happens after the Civil War,

after Appomattox in 1865 is that

many Southern soldiers
go home with their guns,

and they misuse their weapons

to quite frankly shoot and intimidate

former slaves who are now citizens,

and this is a big problem.

I talk about this in the book.

In Memphis in 1866,

it is former Confederate
soldiers and police officers

and judges who are responsible

for hundreds of rapes
within a two day period,

and destroying an entire
community of African Americans.

And they were able to do that

because they brought their guns home.

- But underneath the issue of guns there

is just the fundamental issue of hatred

and inability to see other humans

in this world as having equal value

as another human being.

- Yeah.

- What was the election of 1860 like,

that brought Lincoln to power?

- So the election of 1860
was a very divisive election.

We have divisive contested elections

from 1860 really until 1896.

The 1860 election is the first election

where a Republican is elected
president, that is Lincoln,

but he's elected president
with less than 40% of the vote,

because you have two sets
of Democrats running.

Democrats who are out to defend

the Confederacy and everything,

and then Democrats who wanna compromise

but still keep slavery.

Most famous Stephen Douglas,

who argues for basically allowing

each state to make its own decisions.

Popular sovereignty, as he called it.

And then you still have
traditional wigs who are running,

that was the party that
preceded the Republican party.

So your four candidates.

Lincoln wins a plurality.

Lincoln is elected
largely because the states

that are anti-slavery or
anti expansion of slavery

are not a majority, but
they're a plurality.

And the other states have
basically factionalized,

and so they're unable to have

a united front against him.

- Was the main topic at hand slavery?

- I think the main topic at hand

at that time was the expansion

of slavery into new territories.

- [Lex] Into new territory.

- Right, it was not whether
to abolish slavery or not.

Lincoln is very careful

and his correspondence is clear.

He wants no one on his side

during the election to say that

he's arguing for abolitionism,

even though he personally supported that.

What he wants to say
is the Republican Party

is for no new slave territories.

- Did he make it clear
that he was for abolition?

- No, he was intentionally
unclear about that.

- Do you think he was,
throughout his life?

Was there a deep, because
that takes quite a vision.

Like you look at society today

and it takes quite a man to see that

there's something deeply broken,

where a lot of people take for granted.

I mean, in modern day, you
could see factory farming.

It's one of those things
that in 100 years,

we might see as like the torture,

the mass torture of animals
could be seen as evil.

But just to look around
and wake up to that,

especially in a leadership position,

yeah, was he able to see that?

- In some ways, yes.

In some ways, no.

I mean, the premise of your question

is really important that to us,

it's obvious that slavery is a horror.

But to those who had grown up with it,

who had grown up seeing that,

it was hard to imagine a different world.

So you're right, Lincoln's imagination

like everyone else's
was limited by his time.

I don't think Lincoln imagined

a world of equality between the races,

but he had come to see
that slavery was horrible.

And historians have differed
in how he came to this.

Part of it is that he had a father

who treated him like a slave.

And you can see in his
early correspondence

how much he hates that his father,

who was a struggling farmer,

was basically trying to
control Lincoln's life.

And he came to understand
personally, I think,

how horrible it is to have someone else

tell you what you should
do with your labor,

not giving you your own choices.

But Lincoln was also a pragmatist.

This is what made him a great politician.

He wanted to work through institutions,

not to burn them down.

And he famously said that

if he could preserve the Union

and stop the spread of slavery

by allowing slavery to stay
in the South, he would.

If he could do it by eliminating slavery

in the South, he would.

If he could do it by buying the slaves

and sending them somewhere else, he would.

His main goal, what he ran on was that

the new territories west of Illinois,

that they would be areas for free,

poor white men like him, not slavery.

- What do you learn about human nature

if we step back and look
at the big picture of it,

that slavery has been a part

of human civilization
for thousands of years?

That this American slavery
is not a new phenomenon.

- I think history teaches us

a very pessimistic and a
very optimistic lesson.

The pessimistic lesson is that

human beings are capable
of doing enormous harm

and brutality to their
fellow man and woman,

and we see that with
genocide in our world today.

That human beings are capable,
with the right stimuli,

the right incentives, of enslaving others.

I mean, genocide is in
the same category, right?

The optimistic side is that
human beings are also capable,

with proper leadership and governance

of resisting those urges,

of putting those energies

into productive uses for other people.

But I don't think that comes naturally.

I think that's where leadership
and institutions matter.

But leadership and
institutions came tame us.

We came tame.

We can civilize ourselves.

You know, for a long time

we stopped using that verb to civilize.

I believe in civilization.

I believe there's a civilizing role.

Lincoln spoke of that, right?

So did Franklin Roosevelt.

The civilizing role that government plays.

Education is only a part of that.

It's creating laws, minimal laws,

but laws nonetheless that incentivize

and penalize us for
going to the dark side.

But if we allow that to happen,

or we have leaders who encourage
us to go to the dark side,

we can very quickly go
down a deep, dark tunnel.

- See, I believe that most
people want to do good,

and the power of
institutions, if done well,

they encourage and protect
you if you want to do good.

So if you're just in the jungle,

so, from a game theoretic perspective,

you get punished for doing good.

So being extremely self-centered

and greedy and even violent
and manipulative can have,

from a game theory perspective, benefits.

But I don't think that's
what most humans want.

Institutions allow you to
do what you actually want,

which is to do good for the
world, do good for others,

and actually in so doing,
do good for yourself.

Institutions protect that
natural human instinct, I think.

- And what you just articulated,

which I think the historical
record is very strong on,

is the classic liberal position.

That's what liberalism means

in a 19th century sense, right?

That you believe in
civilizing human beings

through institutions that
begins with education.

Kindergarten is an institution.

Laws and just basic habits
that are enforced by society.

- How do you think people
thought about the idea,

how did they square the idea

of all men are created equal,

those very powerful words at
the founding of this nation,

how did they square that with slavery?

- For many Americans saying

all men were created
equal required slavery,

because it meant that the
equality of white people

was dependent upon others
doing the work for us,

in the way some people
view animal labor today.

And maybe in 50 years, we'll
see that as a contradiction.

But the notion among many
Americans in the 17th,

18th century, and this would also be true

for those in other societies

was that equality for white men

meant that you had access
to the labor of others

that would allow you to
equalize other differences.

So you could produce enough food

so your family could live
equally well-nourished

as other families, because you had

slaves on the land doing
the farming for you.

This is Thomas Jefferson's world.

- So it's like "Animal Farm."

All animals are equal,

but some are more equal than others.

- That's right.

And I think that's still
the way people view things.

- Yeah.
- Right?

- I don't know if that's
a liberal position

or it's just a human position

that all humans have equal value,

just on the basic level of humanity.

- But do we really believe that?

We want to.

I don't know if our society
really believes that yet.

- And I don't know exactly, I mean,

it's super complicated, of course,

when you realize the amount of suffering

that's going on in the world,

where there's children dying
from starvation in Africa,

and to say that all humans are equal,

well, a few dollars can save their life.

And instead we buy a Starbucks coffee,

and are willing to pay 10, 50,

$100,000 to save a child, our child,

like somebody from our family,

and don't wanna spend $2

to save a child over in Africa.

- [Jeremi] Right?

- And I think Sam Harris

or others have talked about like,

well, I don't wanna live in a world

where we'd rather send $2 to Africa.

There's something deeply human

about saving those that

are really close to you, the ones we love.

So that like hypocrisy
that seems to go at tension

with the basic ethics of
alleviating suffering in the world,

that's also really human.

That's also part of this ideal

of all men are created equal.

It's a complicated, messy world ethically.

- It is, but I mean, I think,

at least the way I think about it is,

so what are the things
even within our own society

where we choose to do
something with our resources

that actually doesn't help
the lives of many people?

So we invest in all kinds of things

that are often because
someone is lobbying for them.

This happens on both sides of the aisle.

This is not a political statement, right?

Rather than saying, you know,

if we invested a little more of our money,

really a little more,

we could make sure every child

in this country had decent healthcare.

We can make sure every
child in this country

had what they needed
to start life healthy.

And that would not require
us to sacrifice a lot,

but it would require us
to sacrifice a few things.

- Yeah, there's a balance there.

And I also noticed the
passive aggressive statement

you're making about how
I'm spending my money.

- (laughs) No, me too.

- Spending it a little more wisely.

- You know, I like to eat nice meals

at nice restaurants,

so I'm as guilty of this
as you are. (laughs)

- I got a couch and that
couch serves no purpose.

- It looks nice though.

No, it's a nice looking couch.

- Thank you.

I appreciate that.
- It's a nice looking couch.

It's actually very clean.

- I got it for occasional Instagram photos

to look like an adult.

Okay.

Because everything else in
my life is a giant mess.

What role did the ideas
of the Founding Documents

of this country play in this war,

the war between the Union
and the Confederate States,

and the founding ideas that

were supposed to be
unifying to this country?

Is there interesting tensions there?

- Well, there were certainly tensions,

because built into the Founding Documents,

of course, is slavery, and inequality,

and women's exclusion from voting

and things of that sort.

But the real brilliance of Abraham Lincoln

is to build on the
brilliance of the Founders

and turn the Union position

into the defense of the
core ideas of the country.

So the Confederacy is defending one idea,

the idea of slavery.

Lincoln takes the basket
of all the deeper ideas

and puts them together.

Three things the war is about for Lincoln,

and this is why his speeches

still resonate with us today.

You know, every time I'm in Washington,

I go to the Lincoln Memorial.

It's the best memorial,

best monument I think
in the world actually.

And there are always people there

reading Gettysburg Address,

and the second inaugural.

Lincoln had two years of education,

yet he found the words to describe

what our country was
about better than anyone,

and it's because he went back
to these founding values.

Three values.

We already talked about one, freedom,

and freedom is actually
complex, but it's also simple.

The simple Lincoln definition is that

freedom is the right of each person

to work for himself or herself.

Which is to say, it doesn't
mean you own your own company,

but it means you control your labor.

And no one can tell you

you have to work for a certain wage.

You might not have a job, but you decide.

You decide. Right?

You can see where that comes

from his own background
as a poor man, right?

So freedom is the control
of your own labor.

Second, democracy.

Government of the people, by
the people, for the people.

The government is to serve the people,

is to come from the people.

And then the third point,

justice and helping all human beings.

He, at the end of his life,
as the Civil War was ending,

he never declares that the
South should be punished.

His argument is that

we shouldn't apologize for their misdeeds,

but that all should be
part of this future.

He's not arguing for consensus,

he's arguing for a society

where everyone has a stake going forward.

So justice, democracy,
freedom, those are the gifts.

I talked about the flaws in our system.

Those are the virtues in our
system that our founders,

coming out of the enlightenment, planted,

and Lincoln carries them forward.

He gives us the 2.0 version of them.

- So a few tangent questions
about each of those.

So one on democracy,

people often bring up the United States

is not a democracy, it's a republic.

That it's representative.

Is there some interesting
tensions there in terminology?

Or is, yeah, can you maybe kind of expand

on the different versions of democracy?

So the philosophy of democracy,

but also the practical
implementations of it.

- Sure.

The founders intended
for us to be a democracy.

This argument that they wanted us

to be a republic instead of a democracy

is one of these made up myths.

They believed that fundamentally

what they were creating was a society,

very few of which had existed before,

a society where the government

would be of the people, by
the people, for the people.

That's what they expected, right?

That's what it meant.

So the legitimacy of our government

was not gonna be that the person

in charge was of royal blood.

That's the way the Europeans did it.

Or that the person in charge

had killed enough people,
a la Genghis Khan.

Or that the person in charge was serving

a particular class.

It was that the person in charge,

the institutions were to serve the people.

They adopted Republican
tools to get there,

because they were fearful, appropriately,

of simply throwing every
issue up to the masses.

Democracy is not mob rule.

Democracy is where you create procedures

to assess the public will

and to act in ways that serve the public,

without harming other
elements of the public

that are not in the majority.

That's why we have a Constitution
and a Bill of Rights.

For their time, the
Founders did not believe

that women should be
part of this discussion,

that they were not capable.

They were wrong about that.

In their time, that's how they thought.

We've, of course, changed that.

They believed you had to have
property to have a stake.

We don't believe that anymore.

So we can argue over the details,

and those 50 years from now
will criticize us, right,

for the way we think about these things.

But it was fundamentally about,

this is the radicalism of
the American experiment

that government should serve
the people, all people.

- So democracy means of the people,

by the people, for the people,

and then it doesn't
actually give any details

of how you implement that,

'cause you could implement
all kinds of ways.

- And I think what we've
learned as historians,

and I think what the founders knew,

'cause they were very well-read

in the history of Rome and Greece,

was that democracy will always have

unique characteristics for
the culture that it's in.

If coming out of the war against Russia,

Ukraine is able to build

a better democracy than it had before,

it's never gonna look
like the United States.

I'm not saying it's
gonna be worse or better.

Culture matters.

The particular history
of societies matters.

Japan is a vibrant democracy.

I've been there many times.

It does not look at all
like the American democracy.

So, democracy is a set of values.

The implementation of those values

is a set of practical
institutional decisions

one makes based in
one's cultural position.

- So just to linger on
that topic, is there,

if you do representative,
you said like, you know,

democracy should not, one
failure mode is mob rule.

So you should not descend into that.

Not every issue should be up to everybody.

- [Jeremi] Correct.

- Okay, so you have
representation, but you know,

Stalin similarly felt that

he could represent the
interests of the public.

He was also helping represent

the interests of the public.

So that's a failure mode too.

If the people representing the public

become more and more powerful,

they start becoming detached

from actually being able to represent

or having just a basic human sense

of what the public wants.

- I think being of the people,

by the people, for the people

means you are in some way
accountable to the people.

And the problem with the Communist Party

of the Soviet Union,
this was already evident

before Stalin came into
power, is the same problem

the Communist Party of China has today,

which is that you have leadership

that's not accountable.

- Well, let me go then

to one of the other three
principles of freedom,

because one of the ways to keep government

accountable is the freedom of the press.

So there's the internet,
and on the internet,

there's social networks,

and one of them is called Twitter.

I think you have an account there.

People should follow you.

And you know, recently people have

been throwing around, recently,

for a while the words
of freedom of speech.

Just out of curiosity for
tangent upon a tangent,

what do you think of freedom
of speech as it is today

and as it was at that
time during the Civil War,

after the Civil War,

and throughout the history of America?

- So freedom of speech

has always been one of the core tenets

of American democracy,

and I'm near absolutist on it,

because I think that people

should have the right to speak.

What makes our democracy function is that

there is always room for, quite frankly,

people like you and me

who like to disagree and
have reasons to disagree.

So I am against almost
all forms of censorship.

The only time I believe in censorship

is if somehow an individual

or a newspaper has stolen
the Ukrainian plans

for their next military
movements in the next week.

You should not be able to
publish that right now.

Maybe after they act.

But criticism, opinion,

interpretation should be wide open.

Now, that doesn't mean though

that you have the right

to come to my classroom

and start shouting and
saying whatever you want.

You have the right on the
street corner to do that,

but my classroom is a classroom

for my students with a particular purpose.

- Yeah, sorry about that from last week.

I'll never do it again, I apologize.

I'm really sorry.

- It's okay.
- Never happen again.

I got drunk.

So the people who don't know,

you're professor at UT Austin,

and it's just, it's nearby,

so sometimes I get a little drunk

and wander in there.

I apologize.
- You're not the only one.

Was that you?

I didn't even know it was you.

- [Lex] I'm sorry. Okay.

- So the point is that free speech

is not licensed to invade
someone else's space,

and I also believe in private enterprise.

So I think that, you know,

if I owned a social
media network, I don't,

it would be up to me to decide

who gets to speak on that
network and who doesn't.

And then people could decide

not to use it if they don't want to use.

- So yes, that's one of
the Founding Principles.

So oftentimes when you
talk about censorship,

that's government censorship.

So social media, if you
run a social media company,

you should be able to decide

from a technical perspective

of what freedom of speech means.

But there's some deeper
ethical philosophical sense

of how do you create a world

where every voice is heard

of the people, by the
people, for the people?

That's a complicated technical problem.

When you have a public square,

how do you have a productive conversation

where critics aren't silenced,
but at the same time,

whoever has the bigger megaphone

is not gonna crowd out everybody else?

- So I think it's very important

to create rules of the game

that give everyone a
chance to get started,

and that allow for guideposts

to be created from the
will of the community.

Which is to say that we
as a community can say,

we can't stop people from speaking,

but we as a community can
say that in certain forums,

we're gonna create certain rules

for who gets to speak and
who doesn't under what terms,

but they can still have
somewhere else to go.

So I believe in opening
space for everyone,

but creating certain
spaces within those spaces

that are designed for certain purposes.

That's what a school does.

So I will not bring someone
to speak to my students

who is unqualified.

It's not a political judgment.

The rules at a university

are we're an educational institution,

you need to have the
educational credentials

to come speak about
artificial intelligence.

I'm not gonna bring
some bum off the street

to do that, right?

We have certain rules.

But that bum on the street can still,

in his own space or her own space,

can still say what he or she wants

to say about artificial intelligence.

This is how newspapers work.

When I write for "The New York Times,"

they have an editorial team.

The editorial team make certain decisions,

they check facts, and there's
certain points of view.

They don't allow
anti-Semitic comments, right?

You're not gonna be able to publish

an anti-Semitic screed,

whether you think it's true or not true

in "The New York Times,"

but that doesn't prevent you

from finding somewhere else.

So we allow entities to create

certain rules of the game.

We make transparent what those rules are,

and then we as citizens know

where to go to get our information.

What's been a problem
the last few decades,

I think, is it hasn't been clear

what the rules are in different places,

and what are the legitimate places

to get information and what are not.

- Yeah, the transparency seems
to be very critical there.

Even for "The New York Times,"

I think there's a lot of skepticism

about which way the
editorial processes lean.

I mean, there's a public perception that,

especially for opinions,

it's going to be very left-leaning

in "The New York Times."

And without transparency about

what the process is like,
about the people involved,

like conspiracy theories

and the general public opinion about that

is going to go wild.

And I think that's okay
for "The New York Times."

People can in a collective
way figure stuff out.

Like they can say, okay,

"New York Times" 73% of the time

is gonna lean left.

In their head, they have like a loose

estimation or whatever.

But for a platform like Twitter,

it seems like it's more complicated.

Now, of course there should
be rules of the game,

but I think there's maybe I wanna say

a responsibility to also create incentives

for people to do high
effort, empathetic debate

versus throwing poop at each other.

- Yeah.

I think those are two slightly

different things, though I agree.

I think that my view is that

the failure of Facebook
and Twitter and others

in recent years has been that

they have been completely
untransparent about their rules.

So what I would think would advance us

is if they had a set of
rules that were clear,

that were consistently followed

and we understood what they were.

That would also tell us as consumers

what the biases are, how to
understand what's going on.

It seems if I might say that

since Elon Musk has taken over Twitter,

it's been arbitrary in who's thrown off

and who's not thrown off,

and that's a real problem.

Arbitrariness is in some ways
the opposite of democracy.

- But there's also a hidden arbitrariness

in interpretation of the rules.

So for example, what
comment incites violence?

That's really, really
difficult to figure out to me.

Like, there's a gray area.

Obviously there's very
clear versions of that,

but if I know anything about people

that try to incite violence,

they're usually not coming
out and clearly saying it.

They're usually kind of dog whistling it.

And same with racism and
anti-Semitism, all of that.

It's usually dog whistles.

So like, and they usually have fun

playing with the rules,

playing around the rules.

So it's a gray area.

Same with during COVID, misinformation.

What's misinformation, right?

- I agree, and some of
these are age old problems.

Our legal system,

common law has been struggling

with what is incitement to violence

since the first Supreme Court decisions

in the 18th century, right?

So, you're absolutely right.

But I will say this,

there are certain things that

are clearly incitement of violence.

I'll give you very clear examples.

I'll just make it personal, right?

My wife is an elected
official here in Austin.

There have been people who have put things

up on Twitter calling
for her to be hanged,

or calling for her to be attacked.

That's incitement to violence.

When you specifically call
for violence against someone.

I agree there's a lot of other stuff

where it's a gray area,
but we could start,

if we're applying these rules

by getting that material
off of these sites.

- So some of that is a
problem of scale too.

But the gray area is still,

a forever problem that we may

never be able to solve,

and maybe the tension within the gray area

is the very process of democracy.

But saying like, "We need
to take our country back,"

is that incitement of violence?

- I don't think.

"I think we need to
take our country back,"

just that, no.

- But then, you know-
- Because I might say that.

I might say we need to take our-

- I say that all the time.

Again, I walk around drunk

just screaming it at everybody.

- I thought you wanted, wants
to take you back. (laughs)

- Exactly.

I was very confused

and my messaging needs needs to work.

- But let's go to the
January 6th example, right?

To say "Hang Mike Pence,"

that's incitement to violence.

- [Lex] Yeah.

- To say, "Go get Nancy,"

that's incitement to violence.

- Yeah, yeah, that's very clear.

Again, I don't think
that's the big problem.

The big problem is the
gray area, but yeah.

And the other problem is just how to get,

how to technically find the large scale

of comments and posts and so on

that are doing this kind
of clear incitement-

- Yeah, but this is
something for you to solve.

You're the AI guy.
- I understand, I understand.

- I mean, don't ask me those questions.

It's for you to solve.
- Well, I have to say,

some of that is motivation,

some of that is vision

and some of that is execution.

So, for example, just to go
out briefly on a dark topic,

something I've recently
became aware of is, you know,

Facebook and Twitter and so on,

people post violence on there,

like videos of violence, child porn.

Some of the darkest things in this world.

And to find them at scale
is a difficult problem,

and to act on it aggressively
is a difficult problem.

But I think part of this motivation,

like saying this is a big problem.

We need to take this on.

We need to find all the darkest aspects

of human nature that rise

and appear on our
platform and remove them,

so that we can create a place

for humanity to flourish

through the process of conversation.

But it's just hard.

It's just really hard.

When you look at like millions of posts,

trillions of interactions.

It's wild like the amount of data.

- But where we are now with social media

seemed wild and impossible
five years ago, right?

I actually, what frustrates me

is I think there are people who have

politicized this issue
in unnecessary ways.

Everyone, regardless of their politics

should support what you just said.

Investing our money,

maybe grants from the
federal government in AI,

skilled people like you figuring out ways

to get violent videos off of there.

That shouldn't be political.

- Well, some of that also
requires being transparent

from a social media company perspective,

and transparent in a way that

really resists being political.

To be able to be transparent

about your fight against these evils

while still not succumbing

to sort of the political narratives of it,

that's tricky, but you
have to do that kind of.

And like walk calmly through the fire,

'cause that's what Twitter feels

like if you're being political.

It's like a firing squad from every side,

and as a leader, you have
to kind of walk calmly.

- Right, and that is where we need

a new generation of people

who will have diverse politics,

but will stand up against that, right?

I mean, that's the lesson

from after the Civil War
is where progress is made.

The war doesn't solve problems of hate.

Where progress is made is where you have

local leaders and others
who stand up and say,

we can differ, but we're gonna stop

calling people from certain
backgrounds monkeys,

which was a common thing
to do at that time.

Jews are still called monkeys
in certain places, right?

People have to stand up

while still maintaining
their political differences.

- Several hundred thousand people died.

What made this war such a deadly war?

- It's extraordinary how many people died,

more than half a million.

And this was without a
single automatic rifle,

without a single bomb.

It was mostly in hand to hand combat,

which is to say that these
600,000 or so people who died,

they died where the person who killed them

was standing within a few feet of them,

and that's really hard.

Most of the killing that happens in wars

today is actually from a distance.

It's by a drone, it's by a bomb,

it's by a rocket or by, you
know, an automatic weapon.

And just to make this even more focused,

to this day, the deadliest day

in American history was
during the Civil War.

September, 1862, at Antietam,

more than 22,000 Americans
killed one another, hand to hand.

There hasn't been a day

that deadly in American
history since then.

That's amazing considering
the technological changes.

- What was in the mind of
those soldiers on each side?

Was there conviction for ideas?

Did they hate the other side?

- I think actually they
were fighting out of fear.

What we know from reading their letters,

what we know from the accounts is that

yes, their ideas that are promoted to them

to get them to the battlefield,

they believe in what they're doing.

But here, it's the same as World War I,

and I think the Civil War and World War I

are very similar as wars.

You are in these horrible conditions.

You're attacked and you have the chance

to either kill the other
side and live or die,

and you fight to live

and you fight to save
the people next to you.

What is true about war,

what is both good and dangerous about it

is you form an almost unparalleled bond

with those on your side.

This is the men underarms scenario, right?

And that's where the killing goes.

And it's a civil war,

which means sometimes it's
brother against brother,

quite literally.

And what it teaches us is how human beings

can be put into fighting

and will commit enormous damage,

and that's why this happens.

It goes on for four years.

- And just the extensive research

you've done on this war for this book,

what are some of the worst

and some of the best aspects

of human nature that you found?

Like you said, brother against brother.

That's pretty powerful.

- They're both, right?

So the level of violence that

human beings are capable of,

how long they're able to sustain it.

The South should not have,

the Confederacy should not have lasted

in this war as long as it did.

By the end, I mean,

they're starving and they keep fighting.

So the resilience in war of societies.

And the power of hate to move people.

What are the bright sides?

You see in Lincoln and Grant,

who I talk about a lot
in the book as well,

Ulysses Grant, you see the ability

of empathetic figures to
still rise above this,

in spite of all the horror.

Lincoln went to visit more soldiers in war

than any president ever has,
often at personal peril,

'cause he was close to the
lines, and he connected.

It wasn't propaganda.

There weren't always
reporters following him.

He was able to build
empathy in this context.

And I think, as I said,
war, as horrible as it is,

often gives opportunities
to certain groups.

So African Americans, former slaves

are able to prove themselves as citizens.

Jews did this an enormous
number in World War II.

Henry Kissinger who I wrote about before,

he really only gets
recognized as an American.

He's a German Jewish immigrant.

He's seen as an American

because of his service in World War II.

So the bright side of this is that

often in the case of
war, on your own side,

you will let go of some
of your prejudices.

Ulysses Grant has a total transformation.

He goes into the Civil War
an anti-Semite and a racist.

He comes out with actually
very enlightened views

'cause he sees what Jewish soldiers

and what African-American soldiers did.

- What's Ulysses Grant's story?

What did you learn from him?

Was he a hero or a villain of this war?

- I think he's a hero,
though he's a flawed hero,

as all heroes are.

He's a man from Ohio and Illinois

who was really a failed
businessman time and again,

and had an ability to
command people in war.

Where did this come from?

He was a clear communicator
and an empathetic figure.

He tended to drink too much,

but he was the kind of person
people wanted to follow.

They trusted him.

And so in battle, that
became very important.

And the second thing
is he did his homework

and he had a sense of the terrain,

he had a sense of the
environment he was operating in,

and he was ruthless in
pursuing what he had studied.

So he turns out at
battles as like Vicksburg

and elsewhere to actually undertake

some pretty revolutionary maneuvers.

And then he figures out
that the advantage now

is on his side in numbers,

and he just pounds Lee,
pounds him to death.

Similar to what the United States

does at the end of World War
II with Germany and Japan.

He comes out of the war,

Grant does, he's a believer in Union.

He wants to protect former
slaves and other groups,

and he tries to use the
military for that purpose.

He's limited.

And then as president,

he tries to do that as well.

Right now, we still use many of the laws

that were passed during Grant's presidency

to prosecute insurrectionists.

So the 900 or so people
who have been prosecuted

for breaking into the Capitol

and attacking police on January 6th,

those insurrectionists,

they've been prosecuted

under the 1871 anti Ku Klux Klan law.

So that's a big accomplishment by Grant

and we still benefit from it.

The problem is Grant was
not a great politician.

Unlike Lincoln, he didn't
give good speeches.

He wasn't a persuasive
figure in a political space,

and so he had trouble building support

for what he was doing,

even though he was trying to do

what in the end I think
were the right things.

- What was the role of
the KKK at that time?

- So the Ku Klux Klan is formed

at the end of the Civil War
by Confederate veterans,

first in Tennessee, in Pulaski, Tennessee,

and then it spreads elsewhere.

And there are other
groups that are similar,

the Red Shirts and various others.

These are veterans of the Confederate Army

who come home and are committed
to continuing the war.

They're gonna use their power at home

and their weapons to
intimidate, and if necessary,

kill people who challenge their authority,

not just African Americans,

Jews, Catholics, various others.

They're going to basically protect

the continued rule of the same families

who owned the slaves before

in post-slavery Tennessee

and post-slavery South Carolina.

And when we get to voting,

they're often the groups

that are preventing people from voting.

The white sheets and
the ritual around that

was all an effort to provide

a certain ritualistic
legitimacy and hide identity,

though everyone knew who they were.

- Oh, so that whole brand,

that whole practice was
there from the beginning.

- [Jeremi] From the very beginning.

- Have you studied the KKK,

it's history a little bit?

- I have, and there are a number

of other historians who have too,

so I've used their research as well.

- I'm kind of curious.

I have to admit that my knowledge of it

is very kind of caricature knowledge.

I'm sure there's interesting stories

and threads because I think

there's different competing organizations

or something like that-

- Of course.
- Within the United States.

And I feel like through that lens,

you can tell a story of
the United States also

of these different things.

- They're often business associations.

I mean, there's a lot of
work showing that actually,

people joined the KKK for
the reasons I just laid out,

but also because it was
networking for your business.

You gained legitimacy in
the area that you were in.

So these were community groups

that were formed to help
white business people.

They helped white sheriffs get elected.

What we have to understand today

is when we're debating policing,

this history matters enormously, right?

I have nothing against police.

My cousin, one of my closest relatives

just retired from 25 years

in the New York Police Department.

Thank god he survived.

I have deep respect.

He's one of the best
public servants I know.

But what we also have to recognize

as we respect police officers is that

for many communities in our country,

they know this history.

And the KKK in the 1870s and in the 1930s,

you look at any KKK organization,

as I have in my research,

and you find the police
chiefs are the KKK members.

The local police officers, local judges,

because it was how you
became police chief.

- So these groups infiltrated

some of the main
institutions in our nation.

- I don't even think they infiltrated.

I think they were part
of those institutions.

- The deeper question today
in the 21st century is,

one, how much of that is still there?

And how much of the history

of that reverberates
through the institutions?

- And I'm making the latter point that

it's not there that much
now, but people remember it,

and that matters.
- And some people

would even say it's not there at all,

that there is not institutional
racism and policing.

But if that's the case,
then you can also say that

if there is not direct
institutional racism.

What is it?

The echoes of history still have effects.

- Of course, and that's really important

in that we have to take that seriously.

That's not an excuse for people

then saying nasty things about the police,

but it is what we have to recognize.

Look, I'm Jewish and
there are certain elements

of Russian behavior today I see in Ukraine

that reverberate with the history

of how my grandparents dealt

with pogroms in Russia, right?

Even though what Putin is doing in Ukraine

might not technically be a pogrom,

that history matters in
how I view these issues,

and that's a reality.

- Yeah, I went to 7-Eleven recently,

and what did I eat?

I ate one of their salads.

I'm sorry. I love 7-Eleven.

I'm sorry.

I ate one of their salads

and got like terrible food poisoning.

I was suffering for like four days.

And now I can't, I love 7-Eleven,

I love going to 7-Eleven late at night

in sweatpants and just,
I escape the world.

I'm listening to an audiobook.

And now every time I pass that salad,

for the rest of my life,

I would have hate for that salad.

So history matters.

Even if the salad is no longer
have any bad stuff in it,

it's probably the lettuce
or something, whatever.

Mostly for humor's sake,

but I'm also giving a kind of metaphor

that history can have an individual

and a large scale society
effect on human interactions,

both the good and the bad.

If you actually recommend to me offline

books on the KKK, that'd be really-

- I'm happy to.

There were a few mentioned

in the footnotes in my book anyway.

- And also in part 'cause I also want

to understand the white
nationalism, white supremacists,

Christian supremacists,
or Christian nationalism,

all those different subgroups
in the United States

and elsewhere in the world.

I'm a bit, my mind has been focused

on some of the better
aspects of human nature,

that it's nice to also understand

some of the darker aspects.

Let me ask you sort of a
personal question for me.

Do you think it's possible,

do you think it's useful

to do a podcast conversation

with somebody like David Duke?

So somebody that everybody knows.

So it's not like you're giving a platform

to somebody that's a
hidden member of the KKK,

or like it's sort of putting

a pretty face on some dark ideas,

but everybody knows.

And so now you're just exploring,

you're sitting across the
table, maybe not in his case,

maybe somebody who's an active KKK member,

sitting across from a person
that literally hates me, Lex.

I think that's fascinating to explore.

- I do too.

I think so long as what you are doing

is not boosting someone,

so taking an obscure figure

and making that figure now famous.

But if it's someone
who's already infamous,

and it helps us to understand them,

and so long as your effort is to ask them

tough questions, which you do, right.

You don't give them all
the questions in advance.

You don't have limitations
on what you can ask.

So long as it is a real interview,

not pabulum, then I'm for it.

What I'm against is a softball interview

that allows someone to sound
reasonable when they're not.

But the way I've seen you do this,

when you've had figures like that,

I won't name who I have in mind,

but when I've seen that is,

I think that's useful because honestly,

the historian in me and the citizen in me

wants to understand.

My Jewish grandfather always

was the first to be against

any effort to suppress anti-Semites,

because his view was he wanted to know

who they were and he wanted to know

what they thought, so
he could be prepared.

- And I also see, like,
perhaps as a historian,

you may be able to appreciate
this kind of thing.

That's probably how you see the world.

But there's several ways
to see a human being,

like Vladimir Putin is an example.

One is a political figure

that's currently doing
actions on the world,

geopolitics, internally,
the politics of Russia.

But there's also that human
being in a historical context,

and collecting information
about that person

in the historical context
is also very valuable.

So you could see interviews with Hitler

in 39, 40, 41 as being very bad

and detrimental to all
that is good in the world.

But at the same time, it's important

to understand that human mind,

how power affects that
mind, how power corrupts it,

how they see the world.

- Absolutely. Absolutely.

I would be all in favor,
and maybe he will,

if Vladimir Putin would sit
down with you, absolutely.

I don't think you're
boosting someone like that

when you ask them tough questions.

In fact, I think that's
what we need to do.

Those sorts of figures
tend to insulate themselves

from tough questions.

So just to restate,

I am for the Lex Fridman interview

of those sorts of figures.

I am not for the puff
piece on "Fox and Friends"

where they just come on and they're asked,

"Oh, tell us what you think of this.

Tell us what you think of that," you know.

- So, but there's a balance there

because a lot of people that interview

somebody like Vladimir Putin,

all they do is hard-hitting questions.

They often demonstrate a lack of knowledge

of the perspective of the
Russian people and the president.

There's not an empathy
to understanding that

this is a popularly elected,

you can criticize that notion,

but this is still leader that represents

the beliefs of a large number of people,

and they have their own life story.

They see the world.

They believe they're
doing good for the world.

And I don't, that idea

seems to not permeate the questions

and the thoughts that people say

because they're afraid of being attacked

by the people back home,

fellow journalists for
not being hard enough.

- Well, maybe.

I think that's probably true.

I think in my experience with interviewers

is that a lot of them are really lazy.

You're not, which is why
I like talking to you.

- Can I just say, okay,
this is not you saying it.

Can I just rant?

If you're sitting across from Xi Jinping

or from Vladimir Putin,

you should be fired if you have not read

like at least several books on the guy.

The surprising lack of research

that people do leading up to it.

So you need to be a
historian or a biographer.

You need to be the kind of person

that writes biographies or histories

before you sit in front of the person.

Not a low effort journalist.

And it's so surprising to me that

I think they're probably really busy

and it's probably not part of the culture

of the people that do interviews

to do deep, deep like investigative.

You need to be the kind of
person that lives that idea.

Like see it as a documentary

that you work on for
three years kind of thing.

Anyway.

Of course some journalists do do that

and they do that masterfully

and that's the best of journalism.

- But I think a lot of the times

when the questions are, as you said,

out of touch with the society
that person is leading,

it's because the interviewer
hasn't taken the time.

And I understand you can't be
an expert on every subject,

but you can do what you do, right?

You read my book to prepare for this.

You looked things up.

You had a sense of the
person you're talking to,

and you put the time in to do that.

This is what I always
tell my students, right?

The secret to success in anything

is outworking other people,

be more prepared, right?

What you show is like an iceberg.

It's the tip of the iceberg,
right, is what people see.

It's all the work that
goes on below the surface.

- And if you work hard
enough, which I aspire to do,

at the end of the day,
just like in "Animal Farm,"

you'll be like the horse, Boxer,

and slaughtered unjustly

by those that are much more
powerful than you because-

- But you'll be happy when
you're slaughtered. (laughs)

- You have lived for the right ideal

and history will remember you fondly.

Okay.

What about Robert E. Lee?

So he's the Confederate
general that you mentioned.

Was he a hero or a villain?

- To me, he's a villain.

Many people treat Robert E. Lee as a hero,

and one of the points I make in the book

is we have to rethink that.

And it's very important for our society

because Robert E. Lee pops
up all over our society,

names of schools, names of streets,

and he also embeds and
justifies certain behaviors

that I think are really bad.

Lee was a tremendous general.

He had the weaker side

and he managed to use maneuver,

secrecy and circumstance to give himself

so many advantages and win so many battles

he should have lost.

So in terms of the technical generalship,

he's a great general.

But Lee at the end of the war

never wants to really acknowledge defeat.

What he acknowledges at Appomattox is that

his soldiers will have
to leave the battlefield

because they have not
won on the battlefield.

But he refuses to do what Grant asks him,

which is to help sell his side on the fact

that we're going into a post-war moment,

where they don't have to
see themselves as losers,

but they have to get on board with change.

Real leadership is convincing people

who follow you that they have to change

when they don't wanna change.

Lee refuses to do that.

He says to Grant, I
quote this in the book.

He says to Grant at Appomattox,

"If you want to change the South,

you have to run your army

over the South three or four times."

He's not gonna do anything.

He's not gonna help.

And he becomes a figure
who people rally around,

in the rest of his life
and even after he dies.

So it is as if at the end of World War II,

Hitler had been allowed to just retire,

and he didn't go back into politics,

but yet he was there and he continued

to have meetings with former Nazis,

and people would rally around the idea

of bringing back or going
back to Hitler's ideas.

Think of how harmful that would be.

Lee played that kind
of role after the war,

and I think it's one of
the problems we have now.

I don't think we should
continue to revere him

because it justifies too much

of what the Confederates stood for.

- And that's the difference

that you highlight between
World War II and the Civil War,

that in the case of Hitler,

there was an end to that war.

There's a very distinctive,
clear end to that war.

And you also make the case

that World War II is not a good example,

not a good model of a war
to help us analyze history.

- It's given Americans the
wrong idea of what war is,

because World War II ends
as most wars don't end.

World War II ends with a complete defeat

of the German Army and the German society,

and the near complete defeat of Japan,

and where both sides in
different ways accept defeat.

What I'm pointing out in the book

is that most wars don't
accept with one side,

don't end with one side accepting defeat,

and generally, the war continues
after the battle's end.

This is something that's hard
for Americans to understand.

Our system is built with the
presumption when war is over,

when we sign the piece of
paper, everyone can go home.

That's not what happens.

- I mean, Civil War is a special case.

It's especially strong case of that

because the people that fought the war

are still living in that land.

- That's exactly right.

- And in this case, some
of them are leaders also.

- Many of them become the leaders

of the very areas that
they were leading before.

And I think that's
another lesson here too,

that we did undertake after World War II,

though in a flawed way,
we had a Nuremberg system.

We did prohibit at least Nazi leaders

from coming back into power.

We made an exception for
the Emperor in Japan,

but we generally followed
the same rule in Japan.

Whereas in the United
States, as I point out,

many of the leaders of the Confederacy,

first of all, don't surrender.

They flee to Mexico, then they come back,

after they lose in Mexico a second time,

they come back to the United States

and they get elected to office.

The guy who writes the
election laws in Texas,

Alexander Watkins Terrell,
most people don't know this,

even in Texas, he was
a Confederate general,

fled to Mexico, so he committed treason

by joining the army of
Maximilian, Emperor of Mexico,

who was put in power by Louis Napoleon.

After Maximilian's defeated,

Alexander Watkins Terrell
comes back to Texas,

runs for the state legislature

and then writes the election laws.

It's crazy.

- Can you make the case for that,

that that's a feature of the
American system, not a bug?

That that is an implementation of justice,

that you forgive, that you don't persecute

everybody on the other side of the war.

- Maybe, and I think that's a good feature

in terms of lower level individuals,

but I think a bad feature of our system

is we do allow elite figures

who have committed wrongdoing,

we give them many ways
to get out of punishment.

You are more likely to be punished

in this society if you do something wrong

and you're not an elite figure

than if you are an elite figure.

- That's true.

There should be a proportional,

like forgiveness should be
equally distributed across-

- And it's not.

And it's not.

But we could change that.

We could fix that.

- How do we fix that? (laughs)

How do we fix that?

- What I think was argued at the end,

this is one of the really important things

about studying history,
you learn about ideas

that were not pursued that
could be pursued today.

At the end of the Civil War,

there was an effort to ban

anyone who was in a leadership position

in the Confederacy from ever serving

in federal office again.

That's the third element
of the 14th Amendment.

It's in the 14th Amendment.

The 14th Amendment Clause 3 says that

if you took an oath of office,

meaning you were elected to office,

you're an elite figure and
you violated that oath,

you can still live in the country,

you can still get rich,

but you can't run for
elected office again,

and we've never really implemented that.

- Is it obvious that everybody

who was in a leadership position

on the Confederate side is a bad person

for the future of the United States?

Or is that just a safe thing to assume

for the future of the nation?

- I think it's the latter.

You know, people do things
for all kinds of reasons

and sometimes they have regrets.

That's also why we have
the pardoning capability.

You could pardon someone individually

if they show you that they've changed.

And it would only create
fairness, because right now,

let's say, Lex, you take
out a huge, huge loan

and you don't pay your loan back,

that will go on your credit

and you won't get a big loan again.

You don't get to say, "Just
give me another chance."

You're gonna have to prove.

- Right.

- I think about holding
public office in the same way.

If you've violated your
credit rating on that,

you should have a much higher road

to go to prove to us that
you should be back in office.

- How did the war end, in quotes?

What was the, so you said

and you make this case in the book that

in some sense the elements,

the tensions behind the Civil
War continue to this day.

But officially, how did the war end?

- So officially, the
war ends at Appomattox

in the early spring of 1865,

when Grant has pretty much
smashed Robert E. Lee's army.

Appomattox Courthouse is in
a small town in Virginia.

And the two men meet and
there are portraits of this.

There's a painting of
it we have in the book.

And Grant and Lee signed a paper

which basically allows Lee's soldiers

to leave the battlefield

and leave with their side
arms to go back home.

That's pretty much the end.

Jefferson Davis, who's the president

of the Confederacy goes into hiding.

He's later captured
and then not convicted.

But there's no formal settlement

in the way there is at
the end of World War II

where they meet in Yokohama Bay,

the US and Japanese leaders and sign that.

This is not that.

- So what stands out to you

as brilliant ideas during this time,

and actions too of
Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln?

- So I mentioned his values.

I think a number of the things

that he does that are quite extraordinary.

First in emancipating the slaves.

Now, the slaves were freeing themselves,

but Lincoln recognizes that he needs

more labor in the Union Army,

and he recognizes that there's
still a lot of resistance.

And what he does is he makes the case

for freeing the slaves
based on the argument

not just of the moral value of that,

but based on how that
will benefit the North.

He's able to convince non-abolitionists

to pursue abolitionist policies

by serving their own interests.

What he's basically
saying by 1863 or 64 is,

I can ask for more white soldiers,

or I can bring in former slaves.

Would you like me to take your son,

or would you like me to put in?

It's the same thing Franklin Roosevelt

does during World War II.

He says, we need to build
more planes and more tanks,

and I'm sending all the
soldiers off to Europe.

I've got all this African
American population in the South.

Wouldn't you like me to move them

up to Chicago so we can win this war

and build things in the factories?

So Lincoln uses the war to move

the country forward morally,

even if at times he's convincing people

by using other reasons, and I
think that's great politics.

- I guess that's one of the components

of great leadership is, (laughs)

is do the right thing for
the wrong reasons, (laughs)

publicly sounding wrong reasons, yeah.

- Find ways to move people.

What we talked about before.

Different stories move different people.

So you can tell different stories.

He tells one set of stories

to the religious leaders
who are abolitionists,

and a different set of stories

to the New York bankers,
and that's leadership.

You tell different kinds of stories

to move people to a new position.

The other thing Lincoln
is really brilliant

at is managing the
international side of this.

So one of the real dangers for the Union

is that the British will come

in on the side of the Confederacy.

The Confederates expected
the British would,

'cause again, the
Confederates were selling

all their cotton to Britain.

And they knew that the British leadership,

first of all, was very happy to work

with slave holding societies,

even though they didn't have slaves.

And number two, that they believed

the Union was getting too strong

and threatening the British in Canada.

So there were many reasons the British

might have gone in with the Confederates.

Lincoln mixes sticks and
carrots with the British.

He threatens them,

and when the British actually try

to send diplomats to
negotiate with Southerners,

he interdicts that.

He basically initiates a
quarantine of the South.

On the other hand, he reaches out to them

and tries to show that he
wants better relations,

and makes the argument that they will

actually benefit more from having

the industrial capability
of the Union on their side.

So he's a very good diplomat.

- He's considered to be
one of the great presidents

in the history of the United States.

Are there ways that he failed?

Is there things he could have done better?

- So he failed in the ways that

most great leaders fail,

which is that he had a
terrible succession plan.

His vice president,

who I spent a lot of time on in the book,

Andrew Johnson, who is probably
our worst president ever.

Andrew Johnson had no business

being anywhere near the presidency.

Andrew Johnson was the
only Southern senator

who did not succeed.

And so even though he was a democrat,

Lincoln wanted to show
that he was creating

a unity ticket when he ran
for reelection in 1864.

This happens today, right?

So he put someone on as vice president

who he didn't even like,

but who he thought was politically useful.

Problem is when Lincoln was assassinated,

this guy took over.

Andrew Johnson was drunk
at his own inauguration.

The guy was a true drunkard.

He was not prepared to lead

in any sense, intellectually, politically,

and he was against most of the
principles Lincoln was for.

And the irony is that when
Lincoln is assassinated

in April of 1865, Andrew
Johnson takes over

and he has all the war powers Lincoln had.

That was not good planning by Lincoln.

And we can look back on it now and say,

even though Lincoln is the first president

who was assassinated,

he should have known that

there were people coming for him.

It wasn't inevitable that
he'd be assassinated,

but he should have had a backup plan

for who would take over,

hopefully someone who was
capable of doing the job,

and Andrew Johnson was not capable.

- So for me, for a person,

if I were to put myself in
Lincoln's shoes or anybody,

any leadership position's shoes,

it is difficult to think about

what happens after my death,

after I'm gone, right, to plan well.

But at the same time,

if you care about your actions

to have a long term impact,

it seems like you should have

a succession plan that
continues on the path,

continues to carry the ideals
that you've implemented.

So I'm unsure why people
don't do that more often.

Like I wonder how much Vladimir Putin

spends percentage of time per day

thinking what happens after he's gone,

to help flourish the nation and the region

that he deeply cares for.

I wonder, and it's the same
as for other presidents,

Donald Trump, Joe Biden.

They might think politically like,

how do I guarantee that

it's another Democrat or a Republican?

But do they think like
visionary for the country?

I don't know. I wonder.

- I think that's very rare,

and I think what I understand

from the literature among business people

who talk about this a lot

is what ends up happening

is you become so powerful,

you assume you're always
gonna be in power.

You convince yourself of that.

You convince yourself
that the end is far away.

And of course for Lincoln,

the end could have been far away.

He was healthy.

He was only in his 50s.

He could have lived a lot longer,

but it also, it ended fast, as it could.

And my understanding
is that most Americans

don't prepare their wills and estates,

and it doesn't matter
whether they're rich or poor.

They assume things are just gonna go on,

because it's not fun to think about this.

- Yeah.

But I feel like it's freeing.

Like, you know what I did,

which is interesting,
before I went to Ukraine,

I recorded a video.

I set up a whole thing where I'd record

a video like, what happens if I die?

I'd record a video to release

and I gave my brother access

to my passwords so that,
and I gave him instructions.

"You're not allowed to look at this,

but please publish this if I die."

And you know, that made me,

it sounds silly and ridiculous,

but that made me feel free

to do the best thing I want to do.

It's liberating.

So like, I guess that's for your will,

but also like, do the best
possible damn job you can.

I feel like as a leader, having a plan

what happens if you...

Not if you fail, if you die,

or you lose some of the oomph,

some of the power, some of the momentum

that is driving you currently,

that there's going to be a handoff

and you will still be remembered

as a great man or woman that-

- But you identify one of
the other problems, right,

which is one of the other reasons

why someone like Lincoln

or certainly Henry Kissinger
doesn't create a successor,

because you're afraid they're
going to steal your passwords.

You're afraid they're gonna
steal the power from you.

- [Lex] That's true.

- You had to find someone,

your brother hopefully
who you could trust.

- No, no, no, let's just be clear.

I love my brother, but he's a troll.

So, there's a feature

on whatever password manager
I may or may not use,

and there's a bunch of services like this.

It's interesting.

I don't know if you know about this.

I've learned about all of this.

Is you can have them request access

and it's gonna wait 30 days
before it gives them access.

So it kind of has this
built-in trust padding.

But it's interesting, I mean,

to me on that aspect
is just to have a plan

in all aspects of life.

This is for leadership
and your private life.

Like what happens to not just your will

and your wealth or whatever,

but what happens to other stuff,

like social media and all of that?

- Right.
- In this digital world.

- And anything you care about

if you want it to live on.
- Anything you care about.

- And that's the problem.

But unless you can devise a
technical solution like that,

you have to give someone power now.

- Yeah, and that's the tricky thing.

I mean, democracy is a kind
of technology. (laughs)

You kind of have to figure
out how to do it correctly,

how to have that power propagate,

and especially during war.

How you get everybody together

into this war mongering mood,

and then how do you come down
from that and just relax?

- Precisely.

- So in some sense, with Andrew Johnson,

that was the problem is the
over-centralization of power.

- It was the over-centralization of power,

but it was also that Lincoln

had a designated successor
who was going to do

and tried to do everything

that ran against what Lincoln was doing,

and it set the country back.

We went forward at the
end of the Civil War,

and then we went backward,

more so than we would have

if there had been a new election,

because if there had been a new election,

there still would be reason
for that person running,

even if they were on the other side,

to try to find some compromised positions.

Andrew Johnson inherited power

with very few limitations

on how he used that power.

Congress wasn't even in session,

and so this became very directly a problem

because Andrew Johnson
started pardoning Southerners,

allowing them to come back into power.

- So he had like a few months

where he just went wild.

- Yeah.

It's giving the car keys

to someone who's not prepared to drive,

but decided that they're gonna do

what they want with the car for a while.

- All right. (sighs)

Is there any level to which
power corrupted Lincoln?

A war president.

- Yes, I do think there were some areas,

and I think that even though
he was a great president,

if not our greatest president,

maybe one of the greatest
figures of our history,

he was flawed.

One is his problem of succession,

but also I think Lincoln

over-invested in the
power of the presidency.

He came to believe too much
in the role of one man,

and not in creating a more
balanced approach to governance,

and that's a function of war.

That's where war is dangerous.

War has an inherent centralizing power

in a democracy, and that is dangerous

because even when you have the best

of people running a war,

that gives them a lot of
power to make decisions.

- Yeah, how do you come down from that?

I see that with Zelenskyy
and Putin currently.

It's a war.

How do you come down?

Because Ukraine and everybody,

anybody in the war kind of,

especially if you're fighting
for the ideal of democracy,

it seems like war is anti-democratic.

- [Jeremi] It is.

- So how do you come down from that?

What's the interesting mechanism of,

I mean, some of it is leadership.

You have to be like a George
Washington type figure,

be able to walk away from power.

- I think you gave the answer right there.

You need to walk away from power

or you need to be forced
to walk away from power.

Historically, one of the things that

democracies have tended to do

when they have a chance

is to vote out of office
the victor in the war.

Think about Winston Churchill.

Roosevelt is elected to his fourth term

when he's still in the war.

It's not clear that he
would've been elected again,

let's say he lived on,

because there is a sensibility

that the person has become

too powerful in this role,

and that someone else should now step in.

Someone else who's also
not a war president

but has other interests.

So, let's hope Ukraine wins this war.

Zelenskyy should then step down,

or someone else should be voted in.

It will be dangerous if
he remains president.

Let's say he wins somehow,
and a true victory.

This is just hypothetical.

He should not be, he should be praised,

maybe given a nice villa,

but someone else should take over,

because the problem is that

he's gonna have too much power,

and honestly he's going
to be too out of touch

with what the country needs after the war.

- What do you think would've happened

if Lincoln had lived?

That's the sort of
counterfactual view of history.

It's an interesting question

that probably you think about a lot,

the stories a lot.
- Sure, sure.

- What would've happened if
he didn't get assassinated?

- It's a reasonable question

because it was not inevitable

he'd be assassinated.

He could have had more
protection that night.

He had invited Ulysses Grant
to go to the theater with him,

and Grant and his wife didn't go.

If they had been there,

there would've been more
protection for Grant,

so he would've had at least
double the security there.

So there are many ways in
which he might not have died.

I think it still would've
been a difficult transition,

but I think there were a few things

that would've been better.

First of all, Lincoln
would not have pardoned

all of these Confederate leaders

and allowed them to come back into power.

Lincoln also would've
been a better politician

at holding his Republican
coalition together.

And I think Lincoln was more committed

to empowering former slaves than others.

So we still would've
had a lot of conflicts,

but I think what would've been a degree

of difficulty was doubled or tripled

because Lincoln was removed

and the opposite came into
power with Andrew Johnson.

- So you don't think
there's a case you made

that Andrew Johnson turned
out to be a bad decision,

but the spirit of the
decision is the correct one?

- No, I think it was a terrible decision

because you should never put someone

one step away from enormous
power who's not prepared.

- Oh, in that sense.

So in that sense, I got it.

But the other, the spirit of the decision,

meaning he put somebody who represents

a very opposing viewpoint than you.

- Well, I'm for that
so long as that person

is on board with some of the basic values

that you're pursuing and that person

is capable of doing the job.

- Well, do you think
that was obvious to him

that Andrew Johnson was not
capable of doing the job?

- [Jeremi] Yes.

- Okay.

- I mean, everyone recognized that.

But it made sense, I mean,

what Lincoln has to be praised

for is in the midst of a war,

when at that point he was not doing well,

the war was not going well,
he ran for reelection.

He didn't try to postpone the election.

He didn't try to do anything.

And so he needed all the help
he could get when running.

And so he wanted to have someone on there

who looked like a unity candidate

who could appeal to some Southerners.

So it made sense from a
political point of view,

but it created a really big problem.

And there were people who said he should

have removed Johnson as
soon as he was elected,

and in retrospect, he
probably should have.

- How gangster is that to during a war

still run the election?

- I mean he, Lincoln believed
in democratic values.

He also believed he would win,

but he knew it was not guaranteed.

And it's interesting for
people who don't know this,

the reason we have mail-in balloting

in the US is because of that.

So almost, what?

I think almost a million

Union voters are away from their homes,

and so how do they vote
as soldiers, as nurses?

They vote by mail,

the post office delivers their ballots.

That's why we have mail-in balloting.

- What about the other
counterfactual question

of what would've happened

if Confederate states won the war?

- The Confederate states had won the war,

you would've seen I think a
separate country in the South.

You would've seen two countries,

and that confederate country

would've been a smaller country,

but it probably would've
been able to defend itself,

because it would've actually
gotten much richer than it was.

It was poor at the time.

But through its cotton
trade and other things,

it would've been recognized
by Great Britain,

by France, by other societies,

and you would've seen a Southern republic.

I don't think you would've seen that

Southern republic dominate the continent.

The Union had the men and
people and had the resources.

But you would've seen a rival republic

to the United States in the South.

- Do you think they had interest

to dominate the continent,

to take over the Union?

- They had a foreign
policy, they had a plan.

Many have written about this.

They had plans, many Southerners did,

of expanding into the Caribbean,

which was actually more feasible.

They did not have the personnel

to occupy so much
territory going out west,

if you think about the amount of land

that had to be covered.

But they had the nautical capabilities,

the naval power and the money

to dominate islands in the Caribbean,

and those islands were
important for their trade.

So there were many Southerners

who wanted to take control of Cuba,

wanted to take control of Haiti,

and the Dominican Republic.

And so you probably would've seen

Southern warfare in those areas.

- From a counterfactual
history perspective,

can you make the case that secession

would've been, created a better world?

Like if we were sitting today

and do "Back to the Future" thing.

The secession in this context,

if we put aside the suffering

and the loss of life in the war,

that we would be in a better world today?

Just looking at the political climate.

And can you also make the case that

actually this outcome of the Union winning

the war is the better one?

- I think the Union victory

is by far the better outcome,

because I think what you would've had

otherwise is you would've
had a slave republic

in the South that would've encouraged

slavery in other parts of the world,

would've exported slavery,

and would've necessarily been hostile

to many of the positive changes

that occur in the Union.

The movement toward progressive reforms,

creating cities with health codes,

and public education,
and many of those things.

Public education really
develops in the North

as a way of training
workers who are being paid

to be better workers in a factory.

There's a reason you don't educate slaves,

'cause if you educate slaves, they rebel.

- Yeah, so don't you think

there would be a huge pressure

from the North to abolish slavery anyway?

- There would've,

but I think the South could have survived

without another war.

I mean, I think the way that slavery

would have ended in the South,

if it didn't end with the Civil War,

it would've been with another war.

- I guess the deeper question is,

is it better to work through
your problems together

or is it better to get a divorce?

- I think in this case, it was better

to work through the problems,

not even working through them together.

It's better to work through the problems

where one side has the resources

to incentivize you to
work through the problems,

rather than leaving you on your own

to go your own direction.

I think the argument
against the Union winning

would be the argument that would be made

by those who believe they suffered

from Union power later on.

So you could argue if you're a historian

of Native Americans,
if you are a historian

of the Philippines, you could argue

some of the areas where
this newly united nation

coming out of the Civil War was able

to use its power to spread its influence.

It would've been harder
for the Union to do that

if the Union had to deal
with a rival to the South.

- So as a historian, the Union won.

To which degree are the
people from the Union

that is now the United States

the writers of the history

that color the perspective

of who's the good guys and the bad guys?

- So, this is such an
interesting question because-

- I like how you take every question I ask

and make it into a better question.

- [Jeremi] No, no-

- I deeply appreciate it.

Every time I ask some ridiculous question

and you go, "That's really
interesting." (laughs)

- No, because they're
really good questions.

They're thoughtful questions.

You know, actually the best questions

are not the simple ones, right?

So the axiom is that the
winners write history,

and that's usually the case, right?

Most of the history I
learned about Ukraine

when I was growing up
was written by Russians.

It was Russian history of Ukraine.

Most of the history of Europe

has been written by Germans,

and French, and British citizens, right?

I mean, so usually it's that way.

And for the most part our history

has been written from a sort
of northeastern point of view.

But it's very interesting,

the history of the years
after the Civil War

that I focus on in this book

has largely been written by the losers,

because the Union and its legacies,

and I grew up in New York,

so I'm growing up as a
legacy of that, right?

Those were individuals who wanted

to write about what happened

long after the Civil War,
when the North got rich.

All those beautiful buildings in New York,

all that wealth in New
York, it's 1880s, 90s.

It's the late 19th centuries,
it's the Gilded Age,

and that's what Northerners
wanna write about, right?

Because there's glory there.

The 20 years or so after the Civil War,

the years that really
count, 1865 to 1880 or so,

those years are ugly.

It's messy.

And so who wrote about them?

Southerners wrote about them,

and they wrote a story that was about

Northern carpet baggers and
corrupt African Americans.

And this is the story that

Americans learned until a few years ago.

I've gone around the country

talking about this book

and the number of people have told me

they never learned this basic history,

because they grew up in Chicago.

Not because they grew up in Texas,

because they grew up in Chicago,

and the story they were
told the Civil War ended.

Oh, now let's talk about

the Chicago World's Fair in 1893,

and how Chicago is coming
of age as this great city.

We don't like to write
history in our country

that's not about glory.

I'm all for the greatness of our country,

but you become great by studying

your failures as well as your successes,

and that's a real problem we have.

- And I would love to
see a kind of humility

from a history perspective.

One of the things that always surprised me

just coming from the Soviet Union

to the United States,

as you've, I think, spoken about

is the perspective on World War II,

and who was the critical
component of winning the war.

Obviously in the Soviet Union,

it's the Great Patriotic War.

It's, you know, the Soviet Union

are the ones that suffered,

and often they actually don't
emphasize the suffering,

they emphasize the glory.

- Of course.

- That they defeated this huge evil.

But then you listen to the United States

perspective on this, and it's almost like,

I mean, there's several
ways of phrasing it,

but basically the United
States won the war.

Without the United States,

it would be impossible to win the war.

They were the turning point.

They were the...

My last, my everything, that song.

My first, my last, my everything.

So that, and I'm sure I
wonder what growing up

in maybe after war in Britain,

I wonder if there's history books

written there that basically say,

and they could also make
a pretty strong case

that Britain was central
to the turning point.

You could really make a strong case

that like Churchill and Britain

were like the turning point of the war,

that they're responsible for
some of the first failures,

major failures of Hitler

from a military strategy perspective.

But that's interesting to look at that

very recent history from
very different perspectives.

- And it's the same
problem with the Civil War.

We want to tell the story
of the Union winning the war

and then everything is good.

- [Lex] Yeah.

- And it's not the way it worked.

What I'm really trying to get at is,

when you love your country,

you have to study the failures,

because by studying the failures,

that's how you improve yourself,

and that's where you see
where real courage is.

It's actually that Lincoln failed

for so long that makes
him a great president.

He lost more battles than he won,

but he learned and he
got it right in the end.

Same with Ulysses Grant.

I don't want generals.

I'm just echoing Lincoln here.

I don't want generals,
I don't want leaders

who think they're gonna get
it right the first time,

'cause they're never gonna
get it right the first time.

You never get it right the first time

in an AI experiment, right?

Those who can work through failure,

learn from failure.

And we as a society have
to start doing that better.

We have to not just trumpet the successes.

Let's talk about where
we failed as Republicans,

as Democrats, as Independents,

and let's move forward from there.

- And recent years have been

a kind of movement of highlighting

some of the hypocrisy, sort
of highlighting the racism,

the fact that many of the Founding Fathers

were slave owners, that kind of thing.

Sort of highlighting from the
current ethics of our world,

showing that many of the people

involved in the war on
each side were evil.

What do you think about
that perspective on history?

- I think it's super valuable.

I think we should expose

the gap between ideals and practice.

But that doesn't mean we should throw away

the great people who are also hypocrites,

'cause everyone I've
studied is a hypocrite.

I'm a hypocrite.

I think I'm a pretty good father.

Luckily my son has an even better mother.

But there are parts of me, I mean,

I often find myself telling our children

to do things that I didn't do, right?

But they're smart and they recognize that

and they learn something from that.

So let's not cover over the hypocrisy,

but let's not throw people
away for being hypocritical.

Here's my view of Thomas Jefferson,

which is similar to my view
of Abraham Lincoln, right?

These are incredibly insightful,

thoughtful people who added
so much to our country,

but they also created flawed systems.

And one of, excuse me, Jefferson's flaws

was even though he saw all the evils

of slavery, he was a terrible farmer

and he could not imagine
living the lifestyle

he lived without slaves.

He could never work his way out of that.

But that doesn't make the
Declaration of Independence

less valuable, in fact,
it makes it more valuable.

There's more that we can learn from that.

- And to me, on the hypocrisy side,

many of the people that participate

in cancel culture and
these kinds of movements

that call everything as racist and so on,

sometimes they're highlighting

properly the evils in our current society.

But the hypocrisy they
have is not realizing

if they were placed in Germany in the 40s,

if they were placed in the position

of being a white Christian

during slavery at the
founding of this country,

they would do the same thing.

They would do the evils

they are now criticizing, most of them.

So that it takes a truly
heroic human to think outside,

to be aware of all the
evils going on outside

around you and take action.

It's easy now on Twitter
to call people as racist.

What's hard is to see the racism

when you're living in it

and your wellbeing is funded by it.

- Yep. I think that's right.

I think to analyze ourselves

and look honestly in
the mirror is very hard.

I also think I make this point

in actually all of my books, the real,

and it's an Elie Wiesel point that

a lot of the evil in our world

is the evil of silence
and just looking away.

And one form of that on Twitter

is just hitting like.

Yeah.

It's a cheap way of pretending

you're doing something
that's important, right?

After the Civil War,

there's all sorts of
bad stuff that happens.

I talk about it a lot.

There always are people
there who could stop it.

Most people are not responsible
for the bad activities,

but most don't do something to stop it.

And when I say do something,

I mean really do something.

- Yeah. Really.

And it's also to push back and push back,

silence on Twitter

is not what Elie Wiesel
was talking about. (laughs)

- [Jeremi] Right. (laughs)

- So sometimes silence on Twitter

is the courageous action,

because you wait and think and learn

and have patience to truly understand

the situation before
you take actual action.

Not participate in the
outrage crowds on Twitter,

the hysteria of cancellation.

What's hard to do is to speak up

when everybody else is
silent, that's what's hard to.

- Right, and to speak up against

those who you thought were on your side.

- Yes, exactly.

Good luck to those on the left

who speak up against the left.

And the same, good luck
to those on the right

who speak up against the right.

It's a lonely place.

It's a painful place.

That's why walking in the center is tough.

You get attacked by both sides.

So it's a wonderful, wonderful journey.

- And you know what's interesting to me

and what I learned writing this book.

Every book is a journey.

What I learned in the
laboratory of this book,

right, was a lot of those
figures who do stand up,

even in their own lifetime,

they don't get the accolades they deserve,

but they make a difference.

And that's maybe not enough comfort,

because you wanna see
benefits in your own lifetime.

But I think it really matters.

And many of the figures I talk about

were not even well known in their time.

So you can make a difference.

You do impart something
small in the universe

that can grow into something better,

and we shouldn't forget that.

- Yeah, that's why I
admire a Boxer, the horse.

I will work harder even if he gets sent

to the slaughter by the evil pigs.

- You're on Orwell today.

I love it.

- Recently, I mean, "Animal Farm"

is one of my favorite books.

I've been recently,

I just am rereading
"Nineteen Eighty-Four" now.

It's been politicized
that book in general,

but to me it's a love story.

- [Jeremi] It is a love story.

- The love is, like,

it's a story of an oppressive government,

and surveillance state,

and the nature of truth
being manipulated by wartime,

da-da-da-da-da, so on.

But the beacon of hope in the human heart

that pulls you out, that wakes you up

in a world like that is a
love of another human being.

- It's transcendence, I totally agree.

My understanding, you would
know better than I would,

is that it's now a best
selling book in Russia again.

- [Lex] "Nineteen Eighty-Four?"

That's interesting.
- Yeah, it's actually

being downloaded more.

There was a piece on "NPR"

I heard about this actually.

- Well, I hope it's because
they're looking for love.

- That's what I was just gonna say.

Hopefully not in all the wrong places.

- Hey, there's no such
thing as the wrong places.

Well, that's my opinion.

I'm the one that showed up naked

and drunk to your classroom.

- I'm still surprised
that was you. (laughs)

- I was wearing a wig, I'm sorry.

Quick pause.

Can I take a bathroom break?

- [Jeremi] Yeah, yeah,
yeah, sure. (laughs)

- And we're back.

John Wilkes Booth
assassinated Abraham Lincoln.

In his diary, as you write in your book,

he wrote about Lincoln,

"Our country owed all her troubles to him,

and God simply made me the
instrument of his punishment.

The country is not what it was."

What was the ideal of the country

that John Wilkes Booth believed in?

You talked about this country

that just constantly being
repeated in his writing.

- For John Wilkes Booth
and many other people

who are close to the
Southern part of the country

in the Confederacy,
they believe the country

should be a democracy for white people,

a bounded democracy.

And Booth was horrified,

and we have to empathize with him,

not sympathize, but recognize how strange

it seemed to him that all of a sudden

those who were slaves were
now soldiers with guns.

And he was particularly offended

when he saw in Washington, DC,

a group of African American Union soldiers

holding Southern prisoners of war,

and the world was turned
upside down for him.

Democracy for him, he
believed in democracy,

but democracy for white people,

and that justified mistreating
Black people for him.

- So country means white people.

- Yeah, and I don't think
it's that different from-

- [Lex] And white Christians.

- White Christians, yes.

Yeah, he was not arguing for
Jewish emancipation either.

I don't think that's really different

from what we've seen in the 20th century

for people who justify
ethnic cleansing or genocide.

Let's go to the, you know,

the extreme example of Hitler again

that we've talked about before.

His view was actually,

he claimed he wanted a
democracy for Germany.

He wanted a democracy
of the right Germans.

And he wanted those who we saw infecting

and mongrelizing the society out.

That's in essence what
John Wilkes Booth thought.

- The scary thing is those kinds of ideas,

you can put a pretty face on them.

Like you don't have to use,

and maybe Hitler didn't
until the war started,

or even parts of the war,

make it so clear that you just want

the certain kind of Germans

that have made Germany a great nation

to be the people that
are running that nation,

and other people who are
not truly interested,

don't hold the interest
of the country at heart,

they should go elsewhere
where they can flourish also.

It's wonderful.

But like the good Germans,

they've built all these amazing things.

We should give them the
power and not to the others,

and you can put a bunch of
flowery language around that.

- Precisely.

It's the argument that's made all the time

today against immigration,

that the wrong people are
coming into our society.

It's ironic 'cause it's often made

by those who themselves are immigrants.

And history teaches us
that those who have arrived

as immigrants are no more
likely to like those who come.

In fact, they might be against

the next group for just this reason

'cause they think they're the right group.

- Can you describe to
me if it's useful at all

to know the difference,

if there's a difference
between white nationalism,

white supremacism, and
Christian nationalism?

Is there an intersection between them?

I've heard these terms used.

Oh, separatism too, right?

Is there interesting distinction

that permeated that history
that still lasts today?

- I think there's a long history

in the United States of a
belief in white supremacy,

and it's not unique to the United States.

We actually inherit this from Europe.

And white supremacy is the belief that

for whatever reason, those
with lighter color skin,

usually of Northern European extraction,

are superior, have more rights,

are the better people to make decisions.

All sorts of things.

And it's an aesthetic judgment

as much as it is a political judgment,

and that gets embedded
in our society, right.

We inherit that.

Christian nationalism is the presumption

that it's not just your race,

but now it's also your Christian belief,

and that is actually relatively new.

There are little pieces
of that in our history.

But many of those who
are white supremacists,

even those in the Confederacy

are not Christian nationalists

because they don't agree on
which kind of Christianity,

and they don't view those
who are from a different

denomination of Christianity
as being good Christians.

There isn't this big tent
Christianity in the 19th century.

This notion that there
is one Christian nation

and that we're all part of it,

that's actually really
a 20th century creation.

It precedes the evangelical movement,

but it's been made even more popular.

But it would not make
sense to a Confederate

to say we're a white Christian nation.

It would make sense to say

we're a white Protestant nation,

'cause they didn't consider
Catholics good Christians,

or a white Presbyterian nation.

And so that's something new,

and I think what's particularly dangerous

about this notion of Christian nationalism

is it creates this false history.

Saying we've always been
together as Christians,

that's always how we've defined ourselves

and that's not accurate.

- Well, one interesting thing,

so I recently talked to a left leaning

or maybe a far left political streamer

named Destiny, Steven Bonnell.

I don't know if you're familiar with him.

He does live streaming
debates with people.

It's very passionate.
- Oh, I've heard of this.

My students have told me.

I've not actually seen it.

My students are always up
on the most hip things.

- Yes, that is...

No, no, the funny thing about him,

he's already considered like a boomer.

He's already the old streamer-

- Oh my gosh.
- 'Cause he's been doing it

for 10 years.

- Oh my gosh.
- He's not

the cool kids anymore.

Anyway, he goes into some
difficult political territory,

and he actually had many
conversation with Nick Fuentes.

And he says, I mean some of it is humor,

but some of it is pretty dark,

hard-hitting sort of criticism is,

he says that anyone who claims

to be a Christian nationalist,

ask them if they would rather have

a million people who are atheists

from Sweden who are white come,

or if you would rather
have a million people

from Africa who are Christian come.

And the truth comes out that

this is a very surface level,

this kind of idea of Christian
nationalism is still,

underneath it is a deep racism,

like hatred towards Black people.

- I think, I'm sure that's right.

I'm sure that's right.

- That's the sense I got.

It does not seem to have deep kind of,

yeah, like historical context to it.

It's just a different,

a rebranding of the old kind of hate.

- What I think is important though

in drawing this distinction

and why it really matters
beyond the history of it,

is someone like Lincoln
quotes scripture all the time.

The second inaugural is filled,

second inaugural address,
the Gettysburg address,

filled with biblical references.

But he does it in a way that's
not Christian nationalist

because he's using the text
to bring people together.

He's using it as a fable of humanity.

And you could say he's not
open to Islamic thinking,

he's ignorant of the Islamic world.

But as a Jew, I'm a Jew,

reading and studying Lincoln,

I know he's a Christian,

but I don't feel excluded
from his rhetoric

because I share that Bible.

We have different views,
but I don't feel excluded.

It actually brings people together.

The Christian nationalist approach

that we've seen in the 20th century,

and especially in recent decades,

is intended to divide people.

It excludes Jews.

It excludes Christians

who don't interpret
Christianity their way.

And to say that's what we've always done

is an entire distortion of our country,

and it also hides why
this is so dangerous.

Insofar as Christianity
matters to our country,

it should be in the way Lincoln uses it

as a set of common texts that
many of us resonate with,

knowing that we have different rituals

and different understandings.

Not as a way to exclude people

and not as a cover for
racism, which is what it is.

- It's kind of interesting
that you could talk about,

I've talked to a lot of Muslim folks,

Jewish folks, Christian folks.

There's a way to talk about religion

that's inclusive and
then that's exclusive.

And I mean it's just been,

I've been listening to a lot of these

interfaith conversations
and they're awesome.

They like celebrate the
beauty of each religion.

They banter and argue with each other

about details and so on,

but like, it feels like love.

Like it feels like anybody

from any of those religions

would feel welcome at that party.

- Yeah, and I think that's possible.

- Can you tell me about the
disputed election of 1876?

- So this is fascinating.

The 1876 election is
one of many elections,

we've had some recently, that
are intensely controversial,

and they're controversial
because they're so close.

They're controversial

'cause it's not always clear who's won.

In 1876, Samuel Tilden,
the Governor of New York,

who was running as the
Democratic candidate,

wins more votes across the country.

So everyone knows he
becomes president, right?

Wrong, he doesn't become president

because in three states,

South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida,

it's very, very close.

And even though Tilden
has more total votes,

if he loses those states,
the electors in those states,

all of which go to the
winner of the state,

would actually make Rutherford B. Hayes

the Republican candidate president.

In all three of those states,

you also have Republican
governors who have just lost,

but are still the people who
have to certify the election.

All three states say that Hayes won,

even though it's very close and disputed.

So Hayes has one more electoral vote.

Of course the Democrats won't accept that.

And so we go into February,

the inauguration was done
in March, not in January.

We go from November to February

without clear agreement
on who the president is.

In the end, there's an agreement

that they come to a deal,

which is where the Democrats

will accept Hayes as president

in return for Hayes doing all the things

the Democrats want in the South.

And so in essence, you have a deal made

that one side will get all it wants,

while allowing the other
side to have the figurehead.

And so in a certain way,

this marks a moment when
the Confederacy wins.

For example, Hayes has
to agree to pull out

all federal force from the South,

which means there's no protection

for fair elections going forward.

And you'll see in states like Mississippi,

the number of African
American voters will decline

and not recover again until
the late 20th century.

So that's what that election does.

And from 1876 until 1896,

we have a series of elections
that are very close.

It happens also in 1888 that the person

with the most popular vote loses.

That's Grover Cleveland who
loses to Benjamin Harrison,

and again will have the same
issue where there's a dispute.

And so what that election
shows us, 1876, 1888,

is that our election system

and the problem of having

an electoral college
really complicates things.

It makes it harder for us to
come to any kind of consensus,

any kind of agreement on
who's won an election.

Super important for today,

because most of the 20th century,

we don't have close elections,
so it doesn't matter.

When we come to a world today

where our elections are very close,

our system is not well designed

to deal with those issues.

- Do you draw any parallels with our time

and what are some key differences?

There's been contested elections

Florida, Florida, Florida with Al Gore,

and there's been contested election

after contested election.

And of course most famously recently

with the contested election
that led to January 6th.

- So I think a couple of parallels

and a couple of differences.

One parallel is that when
you have close elections,

the losing side is never happy.

It's a myth that when you
have a close election,

the other side just
accepts it, and it's not.

That doesn't happen.

And we need to be attentive to that

and ready for that.

January 6th actually should surprise us

not because it happened,

but because it hadn't happened before.

People who lose a close
election are never happy

and they always think that
something has been done.

That's one parallel.

Second parallel is elections are violent.

We have this myth that our
elections are peaceful.

No, there's always violence

involved in one way or another.

Violence in either trying

to prevent people from voting,

or violence in preventing people

from preventing people from voting, right?

Elections are not peaceful
walks in the park.

And that's why most countries

have a centralized system

to manage elections and
provide protection for people.

We need to think about that.

A lot of people don't vote
because they're afraid.

They don't wanna take the time,

but they're also afraid that

they're gonna anger someone,

or that they're gonna be seen
as politicizing an issue.

Differences.

In 1876, there was fraud in the election.

There were people who
voted two, three times.

One of the things the Ku Klux Klan did

is it prevented Black people from voting,

and that it helped white people

go to multiple voting booths.

And this was quite common.

In the 1880s, if you went to vote,

here's how it would happen

in a place like Chicago or New York.

The Union boss from your factory

would come and get you at the factory,

give you lunch, get you drunk,

and then drive you from one voting booth

to another and give you a ballot

that you would bring in,

and he would watch you
deposit that ballot.

- Sounds pretty nice, not gonna lie.

I'd take that ride.

- So that's a difference.

That is not how our elections work now.

One of our great accomplishments
has been to eliminate

virtually all the fraud in our elections.

How have we done that?

By creating safeguards.

It is very difficult.

All the evidence we have is that

the minimal fraud that's occurred

in elections are onesies and twosies,

and it's never in the last 20 years

had any big difference in
the outcome of elections.

So that's a big difference.

And then another big difference I think

is that in that time,

the Democrats and Republicans

are on the opposite sides
of where they are now,

and that changes everything, right?

So the Democrats then are
the party of the Confederacy.

The Democrats are the party of exclusion.

The Republicans are more the party

of economic expansion,

and the Republicans
are the big tent party.

We're reversed today.

- Do you think because there's much less

election fraud now, like you described,

one of the lessons we
wanna maybe learn from that

is there doesn't actually have

to be election fraud for either side

to claim there's election fraud?

It seems like it's more and more common,

and it seems to me that in 2024 election,

in the United States,
if a Republican wins,

there would also be maybe just as likely

as if a Democrat wins that

there would be nuanced
claims of election fraud,

because it's become more
and more normalized.

- I think what this history shows is that

our election system makes it

easy for people to claim fraud

because it's so unnecessarily complex.

First of all, we don't have a system

where the person who gets the most votes

is necessarily the winner.

So that already creates one problem.

Second problem is everything,

I talk about this in the book,

is controlled at the county level.

So what happens with
Hayes and Tilden in 1876

is you have one county official

who says they think one person won,

another county official
says the other person won.

There's no centralized system.

It would be as if we allowed

every airport to control
safety in airplanes.

Our airplanes would not be safe.

Our airplanes are safe 'cause the FAA

and the National
Transportation Safety Board

have strict universal guidelines

for what makes for a safe plane,

and therefore our planes

generally don't fall out of the sky.

Our system is very complex.

It has complex rules
and has too many people

who have authority in too
many different places.

Complexity makes it easier for
someone to make an argument

that the wrong thing has been done.

We should simplify the system.

In Brazil, they had a very close election

and it's very hard for Bolsonaro

who lost that close election to claim

there was fraud because
there's a central authority

run by the judiciary
that counted the vote,

and it's just simple.

It's not about which states,

it's not about who the
county officials were.

- Did he claim or no?

- He has not acknowledged that he lost.

- Right.

So to push back on your statement.

I'm undefeated in Monopoly and Risk

because anytime I lose, I walk away

claiming there was fraud
and cheating involved,

and I refuse to believe otherwise.

I just think that accusations of fraud

is a narrative that's disjoint

from the reality of whether
there was or not fraud.

- Yeah, yeah, I agree,

but I think we make it

a little easier for that narrative

by having a complex, convoluted system.

- And I wonder if there's
other improvements

that take us into the 21st century

that allow for electronic voting.

There's all kinds of improvements that

it seems our system is
dragging their feet on.

Ranked choice voting,
all that kind of stuff.

- Let's make this clear.

We claim to be the greatest
21st century democracy,

and we still vote like the 19th century.

We're not even in the 20th century.

Most people when they went to vote,

they actually like, you know,

checked a box and put a piece
of paper in a box, right?

I mean, that's not the 21st century.

We can move millions of dollars,

maybe billions for you, Lex,

in bank accounts from our keyboard.

- [Lex] Thank you.

- [Jeremi] From our keyboards.

- Billions of rubles.

(Lex laughs)
(Jeremi laughs)

- Billions of pennies.

- [Lex] Pennies.

- Why can we move money safely

and not vote in the same ways?

- Yeah.

And at the same time,

so there's security there

in the movement of money,

and then there's the actual engagement.

Most of us, depending
on your age demographic,

click like on Facebook
or Twitter or TikTok

tens of thousands of times a year.

I think this kind of
mechanism of constantly,

and a like is a vote.

So you're constantly voting,
voting, voting, voting.

We love voting.

We love giving our opinion on stuff.

It just seems obvious
that gamifying the system,

which is essentially what the election is,

making it fun to be engaged
on different issues.

And there's also be a case,

now, I don't understand
these things deeply,

but it always seemed to
me that issue-based voting

should be the future.

It seems like too complicated

to vote for singular
people versus on ideas,

which, you know, on Twitter,

we don't necessarily vote for people,

we vote for ideas.

If you like a tweet or not,

you like it and so on.

That too seems to be like a
possibility for improvement.

- Well, there's certainly
a way to improve polling.

We could measure public opinion better.

We still poll as if we're
in the early 20th century.

They still actually call people.

It's amazing to me.

I was talking to one pollster,

they will call 100 people
and get one person,

but they still do that.

- [Lex] They probably still
call landlines, right?

- Yeah, well, they try
to get cell phones too,

but they do call landlines.

But one could create a system

that would be far better

in the way you're describing,

it seems to me, Lex,

to actually assess what
people like and don't like.

- So your book, your work in general,

your perspective on
history is, I would say,

at least from my perspective, nonpartisan.

- Thank you.

- Yeah, you do exceptionally
good job of that,

despite the attacks and the criticisms.

That said, you personally,

just the way you speak,

my judgment, and you
can push back on this,

I think you lean left in your politics

on the political spectrum.

Maybe you can push back on that.

Can you make the case
for either perspective

on your own personality,
as a fan of yours,

that you do lean left
or you don't lean left?

- I think it depends
on the kinds of issues

we're talking about.

I do tend to lean left

on the social and cultural issues.

So I'm a believer, a firm believer.

I didn't believe this when I was younger.

I've come to believe that

people should choose their own lifestyle

and that we should get out of the way.

I'm a believer, deep believer as a father

of a 20 year old woman,

that my 20 year old daughter

should have the right to make

any choice she wants with her body.

And if she were to get pregnant

at a fraternity party at college,

she should have the right to decide

whether to have a child or not.

So on those issues that
would code me left of center.

I'm actually reasonably
conservative on fiscal issues.

I don't think we should
spend money we don't have.

I'm skeptical, I've long been skeptical

of cryptocurrency and things like that.

I know some of your listeners
will disagree with me,

and partly because of my
own ignorance of crypto.

But I'm conservative,

lower C in the way I
think about fiscal issues.

I worry about debt.

I am a believer that
there are certain areas

where the federal government

should play more of a role,

and there are other areas where things

should be left to the localities,

and so sometimes that can
code me one way or another.

But I think I sound
sometimes a little more left

of center because on the
social issues, definitely.

- Well that, because well, I mean,

there's other explanations.

Not to be grilling you too hard here.

- [Jeremi] No, it's fair.

- Because you're also an
exceptionally respected

and successful professor
in the university system,

where sometimes there is
a lean towards the left.

And the other aspect is,

I think your viewpoints on Trump,

where you are a strong
critic of Donald Trump.

And I guess the question I wanna ask is,

you as a historian,

does that color your
perspective of history?

Do you ever catch yourself

where maybe your criticism of Donald Trump

might affect how you see the Civil War?

Like, as you were completely diving in

and looking at the Civil War,

are you able to put aside

sort of the current day
political viewpoints?

- No, I'm not.

I think we have to be honest

that none of us are objective.

We strive to be nonpartisan.

I really liked when you said that

because I think it's an aspiration.

No one is objective.

We all have our biases.

You know, some people like chocolate,

some like vanilla. (laughs)

And that's just the reality, right?

And as far as I know, there's really hard,

it's very hard even to
biologically explain that.

And so my view is that
what a good historian,

what a good scholar does, I
don't care what their field is,

is your self-conscious of your biases,

and you try to recognize them

as you're doing your research,

and you make doubly certain that

where your research seems
to reinforce your biases,

that you actually have the
evidence to make that argument.

But I still believe even doing that,

that someone with a slightly
different perspective

might read the same
evidence in different ways.

That's what makes history vibrant.

So I wrote this book in part,

as I say in the introduction,

because I was self-critical watching Trump

and the things I quite frankly find

deeply dangerous about Donald Trump

and about what happened on January 6th.

And I found I had not
thought deeply enough

about the roots of that in our society,

because I don't believe Trump

or one figure creates
these kinds of movements.

They come out of a deeper history.

- Just a small side tangent.

I do believe your work is nonpartisan,

but it's also funny that

there are a lot of people on the right

that would read your work

and say that you are partisan.

And I think the reason
that can happen sometimes,

not strongly though, I think
you do a really good job,

is like the use of certain words also.

I try to be cognizant of that.

I try not to use words that
trigger people's tribalism.

It's kind of interesting.

So you have to be also aware of that

maybe when you're writing history,

when you're writing in general

is if you're interested in remaining,

you can put on different hats.

You can be carefree in
just stating your opinion

of criticizing Donald Trump or Joe Biden,

or you can be nonpartisan deliberately.

And that takes skill probably,

and avoiding certain triggering words.

- And to me it's about
choosing your battles.

- Right. Yeah.

- So I tried to write because
I want everyone to read,

and I actually think people on the left

and right have a lot to
learn from this history.

So many people have said
to me around the country,

"This is history I wish
I had known before."

But there are moments when I use words

that I know are controversial

because I'm trying to show

there's a fact base behind them.

So white supremacy does exist.

I've had people say

I think that's a politically correct term

or it's a woke term.

It can be used in the wrong ways.

One should not go around

calling everything one doesn't like that.

But the Confederates
were white supremacists,

and I use that word because I think

it's an accurate descriptor

and we need to recognize that

that is a part of our history.

But that does trigger some people, right?

- And because that language is used

to mean other things currently.

So the press will take on certain terms

like white supremacists

and label everybody white supremacists.

Like a lot of people that basically

are in the right or something like that,

they use this outraged language

and that actually ruins the ability

to use the language precisely.

- [Jeremi] Exactly.

- For historical context.
- That's exactly right.

That's exactly right.
- But you do have to,

unfortunately we do have to.

No, actually people disagree.

You might disagree with this.

But I tend to try to avoid,

like take on the responsibility

of avoiding that language.

Like if the press is using

a certain kind of
language, I try to avoid.

- Yeah, what I try to do
is sometimes avoid it,

but where I think the
language is necessary-

- [Lex] Precise, yeah.

- To be precise, but
also to contextualize it.

- [Lex] Sure.

- So I don't call all
Confederates white supremacist,

but I point out where
white supremacist ideas

have influenced them, right.

And I point out where certain individuals

are doing things that resonate with that,

but I'm against these kind of
blanket labels and categories.

- And you also have to speak about

white supremacism in that
context in a nuanced way.

So people use white supremacist

without thinking what that means,

and they just use it as a slur word-

- Correct.
- Like this evil person.

But white supremacist
is also just an ideology

that a lot of people
have believed throughout.

supremacy, whatever, white,

Black supremacy, whatever supremacy.

Believing that some people
are better than others,

some group is better than another.

And there's been nations built
around these kinds of ideas,

and a lot of human history
is built around those ideas.

It's not just evil people believe in this.

We in the United States of America

believe this kind of
ideology is not productive,

it's unethical, but those
ideas have been held

by a lot of people and
not like fringe groups.

- [Jeremi] Right?

- But majorities of nations.

- Right, I'd say the
same about anti-Semitism,

and there are many people
who are not anti-Semites,

but don't recognize that
they're carrying around

or promoting anti-Semitic ideas

or anti-Semitic myths.

- It's a thought that's been
held by a lot of people,

and need to be convinced out of it.

That requires conversation
and being empathetic.

It's not just calling
somebody an antisemite

and you're evil because
you've ever said something

that's kind of a dog whistle
against Jewish people.

You have to be openhearted to that.

These are ideas that you
have to contend with that

you have to ultimately, I think,

heal the division behind those ideas

by having empathetic
conversations with people,

as opposed to, again, throwing poop.

I just like saying poop.

All right.

Ooh, I got a challenge for you.

Given that you have been

an outspoken critic of Donald Trump,

can you say one thing you like,

and one thing you don't
like about Donald Trump?

And perhaps can you do the same

for our current president, Joe Biden,

one thing you like and
one thing you dislike.

- So it's harder for
me to do the one thing

I dislike 'cause there's
so many things I dislike.

But the one thing I
like about Donald Trump,

he believes that America
should be a better country.

I disagree on what he thinks it should be,

but he's not someone,
he's not a declinist.

He's someone who believes the
world could be made better.

I disagree with what he's trying to do,

I disagree with how he's trying to do it,

but I like the fact that
he thinks it can be better.

His whole argument for himself is that

he can make things better.

I don't think he can,

but I think things can be made better.

So I like the second half of that sentence

when he says, "I can make things better,"

take the "I" out, I like
the "Can be better."

Because there are too many people

on the left and the right who think that,

you know, that we can't
make things better.

We have to accept them as they are,

or they're getting worse.

I think a world without hope is horrible,

and I think what he has
offered his followers

is a kind of hope.

- So underneath his message

is a kind of optimism for
the future of this nation.

- Yeah, it's a narcissistic optimism,

but it's still an optimism, yes.

He's promising that if
you elect him again,

he will make things better,

and I think people need to be told

and we need to believe that
we can make things better.

So that part I accept,

and I reject those who say
we can't make things better.

My whole historical career

is about showing that history

gives us tools to make things better.

So I like the idea of
trying to make things better

and giving people hope
and reason to believe

that things can be better.

- What's the main thing you
dislike about Donald Trump?

- I think he has no concern

or care for the welfare of
anyone other than himself.

- Oh, so you mean on a basic
human psychology perspective.

- And I think he doesn't
even care about his children.

I think he's just, I think it's him.

I think he's gone into a rabbit hole.

He might not always have been this way.

I did watch him a long
time in New York City

when I was growing up in New York,

and I think he's been on this path

and I think it's an extreme,

it's a clinical kind of narcissism.

- So do you, when you analyze presidents

and you've written about presidents,

you don't just look at
policies and and so on.

You look at the human being.

- Of course, you have to.

Leadership is about human being.

Policy matters, it's one
part of the equation,

but it's not the only part.

- What about Joe Biden?

What do you like and what
do you dislike about him?

- So what I like about Joe Biden

is in contrast to Trump,

I think Joe Biden really
right now in his career

sees his role as the
shepherd of democracy.

He really believes that it's his role

as president to make our democracy

more stable and more vibrant.

I think he really believes,

I think that's why he's doing
what he's doing right now.

- And he comes from that system,

the political system that basically,

the process of democracies.

He's worked there for many decades.

- It's all he is done.

- Yeah, that's all he knows,

and he wants that to propagate
for better or for worse.

- Right, and he's not an extreme
democratic partisan at all.

He's actually a pretty middle

of the road guy on most issues.

Some people don't like him for that.

But I think he is about democracy.

What do I dislike about Biden?

I think he does not have
the capacity right now

to provide the language
and the public discussion

of where our country should go.

He doesn't have a language to inspire

and build enthusiasm for the future.

- That would probably
be one of my, I mean,

'cause I'm a sucker for great speeches.

And so for me that's definitely a thing

that stands out for several reasons.

One in a time, because we've been facing

so many challenges like the pandemic.

It just seems like, to me,

it seems like a easy like layup.

There's so many troubles
we're going through

that just require a
great unifying president

with a great, like, just.

If I were to speak candidly about

kind of the speaking ability
of Obama, for example.

Obama would just destroy this right now,

both on the war in Ukraine,

on the pandemic, all of it.

The unifying, there's a hunger
for unification, I believe.

Maybe people disagree with that

'cause I think people have become cynical

in that the divisions
that we're experiencing

are kind of already really baked in.

They've really planted their feet.

But I don't think so.

I think there's a huge hunger,

maybe a little bit of a
quiet hunger for a unifier,

for a great unifier.

- I agree. I agree.

And I think what a great speech

does is it's like a great
piece of music or poetry.

It helps you see something in yourself

and feel something you didn't feel before.

It doesn't overcome all.

I don't think that speeches are unifying,

but I think what they are
is they're mobilizing,

and you can mobilize people

to the same mission with
different points of view.

(Lex sighs)

- Do you think Trump derangement syndrome

is a medical condition?

Also, is there such thing as
Biden derangement syndrome?

What I mean by that, it's
a funny kind of question,

but why are people so deeply outraged,

seemingly beyond reason at their hatred

or support of Donald Trump?

But hatred in particular.

I've seen a lot of friends

and people I respect like
lose their mind completely.

- Yeah. Yeah.

So I'm not sure it's a
medical condition or not

because I'm not a medical doctor.

So, you know, as my kids say,

I'm the wrong kind of doctor.

- I'm a doctor, so let me
take you over from here.

No.

The fact that you get the doctor sign

after getting a PhD is a
ridiculous hilarity to me.

Hilarious. Ridiculous.

- So as the wrong kind
of doctor, I'll say,

I'm not gonna comment on whether
it's a medical condition,

but I do think you're onto something.

I think there is a way in which these men

become touchstones of anger,

and there's all kinds of anger

and anxiety that people have,

and I've seen this in
other historical periods.

You center it on one person.

In a way, that's John
Wilkes Booth and Lincoln.

He actually didn't have a
personal beef with Lincoln.

It was that all the things he feared

were manifest in that.

And I think that's an old story,

and then it's made worse by social media

and the way we're bombarded,

and it's like it becomes a drug.

I mean, there are people
I know who hate Trump

or Biden so much and just watch them.

It's not that they don't watch them,

it's that they do watch them, right?

And it's just sort of, and it triggers you

and you get hateful and then you feel

like you've done something

by shouting out your hate or typing in.

And so I don't know if it's
a derangement syndrome.

I think it's a way in which our energy

gets channeled and expressed
in totally useless ways.

- Yeah.

That's the interesting
psychology, which reminds me,

I need to explore that
because I've noticed that.

Believe it or not, it's
easy for me to believe,

but there's people watching this right now

who really hate me,

and they're watching because they hate me.

They hate the way I look, the way I speak,

the mumbling, all of that
and they're still watching.

And I'd like to say that,

as I nervously try to explain myself,

I like to say that that's
not a productive way.

I get it.

I understand, there's a kind of,

'cause because I, what is it?

Is it the same psychological effect

when you see a car crash

and you keep staring?

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- There's some kind of thing

that pulls you in.
- Totally.

- But I feel like it's that feeling,

well, this is probably slightly different,

but you kind of want to,

you want to maybe feel something

and there's an anger in you already,

frustrations from day-to-day life.

Life is hard and you just want to channel

that anger towards something.

But the internet really makes
that easy for some reason.

- And it makes sense of your
life, that's the problem.

For people whose lives are chaos,

hating you and blaming you
gives order to their lives.

- Yeah.

If it makes you happy,
please continue. (laughs)

- Well, I'm curious,

it seems to bother you though, doesn't it?

- Yeah, hate of any kind,

not towards me, just the people,

'cause I think about them
and I tend to think that

most people are amazing human beings

that have a capacity to do
great things in this world.

And so I just think

that's not a productive way of being,

like psychologically
for anything whatsoever.

Everybody has quirks that you can hate,

but you just focus on
the really positive stuff

and you celebrate that
stuff and that feels good.

That has a momentum to it.

I guess the hate has a momentum to it too,

and that's what I'm trying to highlight.

If you follow the momentum of hate,

that's going to maybe feel
good in the short term,

but it's gonna fuck you over
more and more in your life.

And you have to be cognizant of that

as you interact with the internet.

- I agree with everything you said,

but I think people who do things

that are influential and serious,

there always are some
people who hate them.

- I suppose that,

but I wanted to show the difference

between philosophical disagreement

that borders on hate,

and like what's called like hate watching

where you just, which is
what I would say TDS is,

which is you're almost enjoying

how much you hate this person,

and you're just sitting there.

And you forgot, you lose all
reason, you lose everything.

Your capacity to think as an individual,

to empathize with others,
you lose all of that.

You're in this muck of hate,

and somehow it helps you make sense

of this particular difficult
moment in your life.

But otherwise it just,

it seems like a shitty way to live.

But disagreement, definitely,
I like disagreement.

- But I guess what I'm saying is,

and I think this is
your message too, right,

is that don't let the fact
that people don't like you,

or even that some people hate you,

stop you from doing the right thing.

Think about how you can
perhaps trigger them less,

but don't stop what you're doing.

I see too many, and this
is why I bring this up,

too many of my students, too many young,

very talented people who are afraid

to take risks because they're afraid that

someone will hate them,

and that can't get in your way.

- The reality is most people,

or there'll always be at least one person

that will have your back
and that will support you,

and just focus on them.

As long as you're doing the right thing,

focus on them for the strength.

But in general, I'm exaggerating here,

but because most of the time,

99% of people are
supportive on the internet.

It's just that something about

the human psychology really stands out

to you when somebody criticizes.

- Well, it's easy on the internet.

This is historically different

from where we were before as a society.

It's very easy now to say hurtful things

to people and not have
to even deal with them

looking at you in the face.

One of the things that
encourages politeness

is the fact that we're
looking at one another,

and I don't, we are naturally programmed

not to want the other person

to react to us in certain ways.

But when we don't see their face,

it's very easy to say all kinds of things.

- Let me actually comment on that point.

There's a lot of people on the internet

that say that I don't sort of push back

on points or criticize people

or ask the hard questions enough.

First of all, oftentimes I disagree

with that assessment.

But also, I don't think you guys realize

how hard that is to do when
you're sitting with a person.

I don't care about access,

I don't care about them being famous,

just on a basic human level.

It's really hard to ask a hard question

from a place of empathy-

- Except when I'm sitting here,

you seem to be able to ask me.

- No, this is a super fun.

I mean, when it's
brilliant people like you

where there's nothing to
push back on, that's easy.

But there's a basic
human thing that doesn't,

I think it's almost
easier to be a journalist,

like journalists do this well

where they don't have
empathy for the person.

They're just asking the hard questions.

So where were you at this time last night?

Because that's very suspicious.

It's in contradiction to what you said.

And they're just doing factual stuff.

And if you actually
truly have a conversation

with another human being, you empathize.

It's very difficult
because they have a story,

they have a vision of themselves

that they're the good person.

And to call somebody a
liar while having empathy,

basically imply that they're a liar,

that's damn, damn hard.

So anyway, but I'm-

- No, well said. I agree.

- Trying to figure this thing out.

Can you make the case that

the January 6th storming of
the US Capitol is a big deal?

And can you make the case
that it is not a big deal?

- I think the case is overwhelming

that it was a big deal,

and I opened the book with this

before going back to the
end of the Civil War,

because I think it echoes that moment.

You had a group of people
who literally tried

to stop the peaceful transfer of power,

and were intending,

and there's overwhelming evidence of this,

if they had caught the vice president

or the speaker of the house

to do bodily harm to
them or to kidnap them.

So this was a coup d'etat,

that is the definition of a coup d'etat

when you tried to capture and prevent

elected officials from doing their job.

That's a huge deal.

That had happened before
in our country in states,

and I talk about this in
Louisiana, in Tennessee,

and places like that after the Civil War,

but it never happened in the Capitol.

That's a huge deal.

That is, if I might
say, that's like third,

what we would think of
as third world behavior

in our society.

And no offense to those from
other parts of the world,

I'm just trying to make a point

is how we see that as happening
somewhere else, not here.

That's a big fucking deal.

The case that it is not a big deal.

I guess the case to make there

is that they didn't succeed.

The case that is not a big deal

is not that their intentions were not bad.

I don't see how you can
defend their intentions.

The case that it's not a big deal

is they were a bunch of clowns.

And yeah, they broke in, but in the end,

once they got in there,
they didn't know what to do,

which is true.

And so, you know, I think
a professional coup plotter

would say these were the amateurs,

and that they had no
real chance of succeeding

because once they got into the Capitol,

they had no plan what to do next.

What were they gonna do?

You know, steel stapler
from Nancy Pelosi's office.

They didn't seem to have a plan,

and then what ended up happening,

they left the building.

- Well, that would be the case

that's not a big deal
because their intention

was not to overthrow.

Their intention was to protest,

because if the intention was to overthrow,

it would be much more organized.

- I think the evidence
is pretty overwhelming

that they intended,

they were there to stop the
certification of the election.

They were there to prevent Donald Trump

from having to leave office.

They just didn't have a good plan.

This was the Keystone Cops.

- So you're saying there is statistically

some possibility that this would

have succeeded at halting the
basic process of democracy.

- You could imagine a
scenario where it might have,

if they had gotten lucky, sure.

If they had caught the vice president.

- But what could've, if they
caught the vice president-

- They couldn't go on and certify then.

He has to be there.

- No, but don't you think that

would resolve itself through
police action and so on?

My question is how much is
this individual hooligans,

and how much of this
is a gigantic movement

that's challenging the
very fabric of a democracy?

- No, well, it's not a gigantic movement,

but it was a small coup d'etat

that could have actually made

the transition much more difficult.

Was there a scenario where Donald Trump

stayed in office legitimately?

No.

But was there a scenario
where they created

a great deal of chaos

that further undermined our democracy?

Absolutely, yes.

Here's how it would happen, right?

They capture Pence, right?

They either kidnap him
and try to ransom him,

which is what they were trying to do

with the Michigan
Governor, Governor Whitmer,

or they kill him and
then Donald Trump says,

"Okay, well, there's no vice president,

so you can't certify."

The Senate would choose someone else

to be vice president
but Donald Trump says,

"No, that's not legitimate."

- Do you think it's possible

Donald Trump would say
something like that?

- Absolutely.

- [Lex] I disagree with you.

- He said that morning that
Pence should not certify.

He said that morning.

- But there's a difference

between sort of Twitter rhetoric.

- No, he said it at a rally.

- Sure. Rally rhetoric.

And there is a threshold.

It feels like a big leap.

- He asked people around him

in the Oval Office how he
could make that happen.

He tried to get a new person

appointed Attorney
General who would do that.

He tried to find legal
justification for it.

I think the evidence is overwhelming

that Trump was supportive of efforts

after the election didn't go the way

he wanted to keep him in office.

And whether that's legally actionable,

and whether one thinks that means

he's a bad president or not

is a matter of opinion,
but facts are facts.

- Yeah, but I just wonder if it's possible

for him to have stayed president

in this kind of context.

It seems like a heated,
just like you said,

elections can even be violent.

They're heated.

People are very upset.

When Donald Trump won
the presidency in 2016,

I was in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The amount of anger,

the energy I was getting from people.

I mean, if there was any
way to channel that anger,

I think people would be in trouble.

- But let's-
- There's anger.

- Yeah, I agree with
that, and that is right,

and elections are violent, as I said.

But this is different.

This is the person in the
office of the presidency

using the power of the presidency

to try to stay in office,
to imperil people's lives,

to distort our government

on a scale we had not seen before.

And these are not opinions of mine.

We have the documentary evidence,

we have the testimony
from people about this.

We can differ over what you think

of his presidency as a whole.

We can differ over whether you think

he should be held legally responsible,

those are matters of opinion.

But the facts are he sat on January 6th,

watched it on TV, did not send ever,

ever did he ever send any
protection for Congress.

That is his job.

And throughout asked, continued to ask

how the certification could be prevented.

- To you, that's not
incompetence, that's malevolence.

- Absolutely.

If I watch my children getting harmed

and I don't do something
about it, I'm watching it,

and in fact I take action that

tries to help those
who are doing the harm,

you would not just say I'm
an incompetent president,

parent, you would say I
was a negligent parent

and you'd call parental support
to take away my children.

- I was troubled by the
way the press covered it,

that they politicized
the crap out of that.

And not just the press,

but also Congress itself.

It just seemed like
impeachment and all of this,

that just seemed to be a kind of circus

that wasn't interested in
democracy or non-partisanship.

I don't, so it's very difficult for me

to see the situation with clear eyes

because it's been colored by the press.

It's very difficult for me
to know what is even true.

- Members of Congress, including
our members of Congress

from our district and others, right,

their lives were threatened.

They were traumatized.

I have a lot of students,

at least a dozen who are staff members,

more than half are Republicans.

Part of what traumatized them

was that the president

did not do his job to protect-

- [Lex] Did not protect them.

- Yes, as a child would be traumatized

not only if harmed by someone,

but if mom and dad don't
do everything they can.

One of the things that
makes people feel safe

is they know their parents,

they know their person in authority

can't always keep them
safe, but they wanna know

the person's always trying.

- I agree with you that they're,

listen, I'm somebody that believes

in this kind of idea of family,

especially with people I work with.

That to me is a high ideal to protect.

But that's a little bit different-

- [Jeremi] It's his job.

- Hold on a second.

That's a little bit different

than protecting democracy.

Those are two different things.

Protecting your employees

and protecting democracy as an ideal.

You could say he didn't protect either,

but I think the criticism that

he didn't protect the
employees is one thing.

- But the employees in this case

are the ones carrying out democracy.

So it's like saying the general

who doesn't protect his soldiers

is maybe not protecting his employees,

he's also not protecting
the war effort, right?

It is his, the people we're talking about

are the people who are actually doing

the work of democracy at that moment.

The most basic function of democracy,

which is certifying
votes, and their lives.

I'm telling you, I had students,

one who works for Senator
Romney, for example,

who spent hours in a closet
hearing people outside,

looking on her phone,

"When is the president sending people

to protect us so we can do our job?"

And she was not happy with the way

the election turned out,

but she was there to do her job

because she believes in democracy,

to service the Senate
and the Senate's role.

- What should have Donald Trump done,

without turning him into
a different human being?

- He should have immediately,

just as we were watching
things get breached,

the moment they had that
the members of the house

and the Senate had to evacuate
their respective chambers,

he should have immediately gone on TV

and Twitter and every space he could

and tell his supporters to leave

and say what he never said.

"This is unAmerican what you're doing.

This is unacceptable."

He never used those words.

"This is unAmerican, this is unacceptable.

I'm completely against anyone storming

the Capitol like this.

Go home now, please."

- Or you can use his own language,

but tell 'em to leave.

- Yeah.

And immediately, we know
he was watching for hours,

and we have testimony
from his own daughter,

from Ivanka saying she
tried time and again

to get him to say something
earlier on and he didn't.

He watched it.

- He can still criticize
all the politicians,

he can criticize everyone he wants,

but he should have told them to leave.

- All he has to do in that moment

is basic protecting democracy,

protecting the Capitol.

Leave, tell them to leave

and do everything he can to find

any kind of force he can give

to go protect the Capitol.

- I wonder how difficult

it is to lose a presidential election.

- It's happened so many times, we know-

- I understand that,

but especially when, like, what is it?

You know, 80 million people vote for you,

or like millions and millions

and millions of people vote for you.

It's crazy. It's crazy.

This democracy thing is crazy.

- George H. W. Bush won a war
in the Middle East, right.

He had 90% approval rating,

and then a year later lost
the election to someone,

Bill Clinton, he thought had
none of the experience he had,

someone he believed didn't
have the right moral character.

And Bush did everything he could

to help the next
president get started well

and they became good friends.

George W. Bush, he didn't love Obama.

That's considered one of
the smoothest transitions.

George W. Bush ordered every single person

in his administration to do everything

they could to help the new admin.

That's what a leader does.

- Yeah, humility is one of the things

I admire in leaders. (sighs)

Well, that felt heated. (laughs)

Speaking of which, can you just linger

on how do you think we can heal
the divide in this country?

Do you think it's possible?

There feels to be a strong division.

- I think we can heal the divide.

I think, as you said,

there's so many opportunities

with new technology to
bring people together,

just as we're using it to tear them apart.

I have the best job in the world

because I get to teach so many students.

I'll have 300 in my class in the spring

in US history class.

And what I've found with my students

is they're mostly not
Democrats or Republicans.

They mostly care about the same things.

Every one of my students seems
to care about climate change.

- Oh, I thought you were
gonna say TikTok, but okay.

Second to that, climate change.

- You know, and I think they
offer a new future for us,

and here's what I'll say as a historian.

We go through cycles of division

and cycles of less
division, less partisanship.

One moment when it seems
people agree too much

on the mainstream, encourages
people to go to the extremes.

When people see the extremes,

they wanna come back to the middle,

and that is where my students are.

Most of my students want lower inflation.

They agree with Republicans on that,

but they want more to be
done about climate change.

They're in the middle on these issues.

And I think giving them more opportunity.

So what's the best way to
heal our divisions, honestly?

Get the old men out and
the young women and men in.

- Because they ultimately don't have

that same division like deeply baked in.

- Not only that, they find it disgusting

in the way you and I do.

- Yeah, that's true.

What's the right way
to have conversations?

I mean, just to stay on that,

with people on the left and the right.

Yeah, I mean, I don't know
how often you practice this,

you care about politics.

How often do you talk to people

who voted for Trump or
who are Republicans?

- It's hard.

I try, but it's hard.

75% of people I talk to
are not those people.

- Do you have people
who are Trump supporters

in your extended family?

Thanksgiving?

- No, I don't in my extended family.

- Are they no longer? (laughs)

- They're no longer in
my family, yeah. (laughs)

- Secession.
- In Stalinist fashion,

I have taken them out of the photograph.

- [Lex] They do not.

Yeah, you just erase.

- I do, but I know, I have friends,

yeah, who fall into that.

But it's still a minority
of my friend group.

So I want to, you know, be clear that

I'm not as good at this as I should.

But I think we do have to reach out.

But I also, I'm less interested honestly

in refighting old battles with old dogs.

I'm more interested in finding ways

to get a new crop of people educated

and involved and engaged

without imparting the
same partisanship on them.

So I will support, I mean this,

I will support and encourage,

especially any student of mine,

but any young person who
is smart, has good ideas.

I don't care whether,

I don't ask whether they're
a Democrat or Republican.

And I have given money
to some young candidates

who are not Democrats.

So that's the way.

I think it's a generational change,

and I think it's reaching out

and trying to get people

to see beyond partisan divisions

who are in their 20s
and teens rather than,

that's why we do our
podcast, "This is Democracy."

Zachary and I do that, my son and I,

because exactly that.

You will never hear an episode

where we take one side or another.

Our goal is to explain the issue,

whether it's the challenges
of democracy in China,

or it's climate change, whatever it is,

or its memory of war in our society.

And to explain the issue

and then offer people
an optimistic pathway

that's neither one side nor the other.

- So actually, to push back
a little bit on young people,

I do see that, the exhaustion

with the sort of partisanship,

but I've also, and this
I think is the case

throughout history, and I see it now,

especially in the teenage years,

especially, if I'm
being honest with, boys,

there's a desire for extremism
in various directions.

All kinds of extremism.

Like just extreme awesomeness

or extreme anything.

Just extreme.

And F the man that
tries to make me behave,

this kind of energy.

And that's why you can take any ideology,

basically any extreme ideology
starts being exciting.

Whether you're a Marxist or communist,

you're not just gonna be like
for socialized healthcare.

You're gonna be like, no,
no, no, no, no. (laughs)

Let's go full hammer and sickle.

I'm gonna wear red,

and then the same with white supremacy,

or just the way you see society,

the way you see the world,
the extremism is there.

And part of that, it's kind of,

to steal that perspective, I mean,

it can be productive that
energy if it's controlled.

And especially if we have institutions

that keep it a little under like control.

One of the criticisms I have,

a lot of people have.

I'm actually much more moderate

than that criticism.

Of universities is they give a little

too much power to the 18 year old

who just showed up with
their Marxist like books

and so on, and they want to
burn the whole thing down.

That's beautiful.

But the whole process of the university

is to get different
viewpoints, educate more,

and make that person's
viewpoint more sophisticated,

complex, nuanced and
all that kind of stuff.

- I think you're right,

but I think that's more talk than action.

In my experience there is,
especially among young men,

you're absolutely right,

there is a valorization of the tough guy,

because most men 18 and 19

are still not fully comfortable
in their masculinity,

however they're going to define it.

And so a way of performing that

is being extreme in one way or another.

And I've definitely seen that,

but I think it's more
often than not rhetoric,

and actually there's a very strong power

of peer pressure and conformity
that works on young people.

And the positive side of that

now is the peer pressure among them

is not to join one party or the other.

It's to say, "This is terrible,

look at how our parents
are screwing things up."

And they're right, and I
think we can lean into that

and get a lot of positive
creative action out of that.

On universities, you
brought this up a few times

and I think we have to be careful.

I think you and I agree on this.

It's not that universities
are free of bias,

but the universities,
especially large universities,

whether it's UT, MIT, Yale,

whatever we're talking about, right?

They're large complex empires.

And most universities, people in the arts

tend to be a little left of center.

It's self selection.

Those in engineering tend to
be pretty much in the middle,

and those at business schools
tend to be right of center,

and so I think we need to be
careful not to generalize.

You know, at the University of Texas,

there's as much influence
from the business school

and the athletic department

as there is from the humanities.

So it's not a left-leaning campus.

And that's also true at Yale.

You have the School of Management at Yale,

you have a huge medical school, right?

People who are very professional

and less political on
a lot of these issues.

So I think we have to be careful.

I think there's certain pockets of things,

but some of that you're
never going to avoid, right?

Engineers are always
gonna be the people who-

- Hey, now. Easy, now.

- No, but I'm sure,

who want to generally find

some objective measure

and avoid political interpretation, right?

They wanna find their objective measure.

- I'm surprised how most people

in like robotics don't seem to,

they're afraid of humans.

They run away from humans.

- Precisely. Precisely.

And the arts people are always

gonna be more touchy-feely,

and the business people

are always gonna like markets, I mean.

- My own personal opinion on this is,

this is just me talking,

and I don't know if it's grounded in data,

but just my own experiences.

It seems a lot of the things

that people criticize about universities

comes from administrations,
from the bureaucracies.

The faculty and the
students, even with biases,

are really interesting people
and all of their different,

I wouldn't call 'em biases,

but the different perspectives
add to the conversation.

It's the admin, too much.

Of course, you need, just
like with institutions,

you need some, but too much,

it becomes too heavy handed.

And somehow that has been getting

a little bit out of hand
at a bunch of universities,

just too much administration.

And I don't know what the mechanism

is to make it more efficient,

but that's been always the struggle.

Maybe the public criticism

is the very mechanism
that makes universities,

the administration smaller.

- Absolutely.

We have those issues,

and you can also say athletics

has gotten out of control.

- Sure. Yeah.

Like you said, you co-host a podcast

with your son Zachary
called "This is Democracy."

What's been, there's a
million questions I can ask,

but just that pops to memory,

what's been a challenging

or maybe an eye-opening
conversation you've had on it?

- Oh, we've had a lot of
eye-opening conversations.

Our most recent episode

is an episode on the German right.

As I'm sure many of your listeners know,

there was a group called the Reichsburger,

I think they still exist in Germany.

They were actually led by
a former German prince.

And they had been planning to assassinate

the Bundes Chancellor

and were organizing all
sorts of other efforts.

They do not believe that

the current German
government is legitimate.

They think the last legitimate government

was the Nazi government.

They see the whole post-war
period as illegitimate.

- So this is the German far right.

- Correct.

And we had on a member
of the German Bundestag,

of their parliament who's been involved

in the investigations

or in the oversight of the investigations,

and talking with her about the depth

of these issues and the challenges

they face in Germany.

It's certainly not a huge
part of German society,

but it's a significant number of people,

probably more than 20,000
people who are part of this.

To me, brought home how
much of what we thought

was the past is still in the present,

and I think that's a
recurring theme in our show.

And our show is optimistic.

It's not about woes to the world.

It's actually about taking issues,

we take a topic each
week that's in the news,

we go back to understand the history,

and we then use that history
to make better policy,

to talk about how to
make better policy today.

And in this case, it was
clear that even in Germany,

there's a lot of unfinished work

in explaining to people and helping those,

for instance, in the former East,

where a lot of this group has its support,

why this government is legitimate,

why it operates the way it does,

and addressing their concerns.

It was strikingly similar

to some of the problems
we have on our own.

It's interesting.
- Yeah, it's interesting

that there's a far right
movement in Germany.

So you look at different
parts of the world as well.

- We do.
- Not just the United States.

- We do.

We did an episode recently on China,

on the effects of zero COVID
and the protests in China.

We've done a number of
episodes on the war in Ukraine.

Our role each week is to have

on either a policymaker, a scholar

or an activist who can help us understand

an issue and get beyond partisanship.

So what's been eyeopening
are some of the details,

but what's also been eyeopening, honestly,

is how easy it is to have
a nonpartisan conversation.

It's not hard.

We open every episode with
a poem that Zachary writes.

He writes an original poem.

I'll brag on my son.

He's the Youth Poet Laureate
in Austin right now,

and he writes a poem on each topic.

- What's the style of poetry usually?

Is he dark?

- No, he's usually, he's often ironic.

- Ironic, like with a bit of humor?

- Yes.
- Okay.

- And he likes word plays.

- So he is not like a rebellious,

dark teenager that's just-

- No.

He's a creative know-it-all. (laughs)

- Strong words.

He would probably disagree.

- [Jeremi] But what's interesting-

- Sounds like you're the
know-it-all on the podcast.

- Oh, no. Oh, no.

We do have a lot of followers

and most of them comment on him,

they don't comment on me.

So I'm the junior partner.

- You're the Yoko Ono of the partnership.

- Correct.
- I'm just kidding.

- But what I will say,

and this is a really optimistic thing

that I deeply believe, if
you frame things properly,

you open with a poem,
you open with questions,

not with partisan positions,

even when we have someone
on who's a known Republican

or Democrat, we can have a
very nonpartisan conversation.

I mean, of course we get criticisms,

but we're almost never criticized

for being partisan one way or the other.

It's not hard to do this.

You just have to make an effort to avoid

the partisan clap trap
that we can all fall into.

- Focus on the humanity.

What has your brilliant popular son

Zachary taught you about life?

- Oh, he is taught me
so much in his 18 years,

as has our daughter who's 20.

Two things stand out.

He's taught me that a new
generation has so much to offer.

And I don't just mean because he's smart

and engaged, as our daughter is too.

I also mean that you realize

when you have a child that

even though you're doing
the same things with them,

they see the world
differently and legitimately.

And it reminds us that the world

can be seen legitimately
in different ways.

And it's not that he and I disagree

on major political issues,

it's actually the small stuff
that he sees differently.

- Like in the details,
you see that you can have

very different perspectives.

- [Jeremi] Exactly.

- You have a very different way to draw,

to create a painting of the same scene.

- And then the other
thing he's taught me is,

as I said about the poetry,
the importance of the arts.

I've always been a lover of the arts,

but it had always been, in some ways,

parallel to my historical scholarship.

We need to do a better job of integrating,

as the Greeks did, right?

The artistry, all the things we do,

we separate them as disciplines,

but they're all deeply connected.

This is what I like about
your podcast, honestly,

is that you integrate all of these things.

You'll have people on with AI,

you'll have a guy doing arm wrestling.

You have all these things together, right?

And it's that these worlds come together

and there's a lot to
gain by bringing the arts

and the sciences and all this together.

It's an obvious thing
to say, but we forget.

- Yeah, and somehow it becomes

bigger than the individual parts.

What gives you hope about the future?

You looked at, especially with this book,

at just such a divisive
part of our history,

and the claim, the idea that
you carry through the book

that that division still
permeates our society.

So what gives you hope?

- I try to end the book
on a very hopeful note,

because I am hopeful.

I'm hopeful that these divisions

were made by people and
can be unmade by people.

I do not believe that what
I describe in this book,

the division, the hate
that we see today as well,

I don't think it's inevitable.

I think it can be actually
corrected quite easily,

and corrected easily by addressing

the challenges in our institutions,

the ways in which this history

has been embodied in our institutions,

even though we're different,

and through our own recognizing of it.

The gift of the last few years,

I don't care whether you're
a Democrat or Republican,

the gift of the last few years

is that we've been able to
see the horror around us,

and once you see the horror,

you can do something about it.

What's dangerous is
when the horror is there

and you don't see it, and it's hidden.

It's been unmasked.

I don't care where you stand.

I've probably spoken in about
25, 30 cities about this book.

Every audience I've asked,

"How many of you have been shaken

by the last four to five years?"

And everyone everywhere
has raised their hand.

That's a gift.

That's consciousness raising.

I grew up in a time in the 1980s

when we were concerned that
everyone was apathetic.

That was what was being said.

We had lower voter
turnout than we have now.

People didn't seem to care.

My students, when I was an early young,

I'm still young.

When I was a very young
professor in the early 2000s,

my students all wanted
to go work for banks.

They just wanted to make money.

The best students wanted
to go work for Goldman.

We're not in that world anymore.

There's been a consciousness raising.

Knowing there's a problem,

naming the problem gives us
a chance to fix the problem,

and I think that's where
we are as a society now.

- Young people are excited
to solve the problem.

Do you think the individual,

like if a young person
is listening to this,

do you think the individual
has power in this?

- Absolutely.

I think the individual has
a huge amount of power now.

There's a demographic reason.

We've got all these old people

who have held on too long.

Look at President, look at Senate,

and look at any institution.

And they're all, we're
reaching a demographic cliff.

Unlike China, we have a large
population that's coming up.

So those who are watching
now who are in their 20s,

they're gonna get to move
into leadership positions

much faster than their parents did.

- (laughs) Let's go.

- Yeah, so that's one.

And then the second thing

is just what we're doing here.

I mean, social media, when used properly,

gives a platform to young people.

You know, they don't have to go through

"The New York Times" like I do, right?

This is why I do the podcast with my son.

Find other ways.

You reach millions of people

and this can be done.

You don't need to wait for the old guys

to give you the check mark that it's okay.

- Just put on a suit, get a haircut,

and start speaking nonsense
into microphone, and yeah.

- Well also, I mean, have
a very neat place. (laughs)

- That's why I love you.

All right, Jeremi,

you're an incredible human being.

Thank you for talking once more time.

Thank you for writing this important book.

I hope you keep writing

and I hope to keep talking to you

'cause you're this shining beacon

of political hope I have here in Austin

that we get to enjoy.

- I want to thank you for having me on,

and thank you for your show.

I think what you're doing is so important

and I really deeply respect what you do.

- Thanks for listening

to this conversation with Jeremi Suri.

And now, let me leave you

with some words from Abraham Lincoln.

"Nearly all men can stand adversity.

If you want to test a man's
character, give them power."

Thanks for listening and
hope to see you next time.

foreign

lies in the future the cultural future

that is unfolding in front of all of us

and uh

these times spent and then of course

there were the times in the Amazon which

most of you have heard me lecture on

where the pursuit of psychedelic plants

was really in the Forefront but uh

I came to see nature as experienced

meaning as it hits you when you walk

around in it and pick at it and carry it

with you that this kind of nature had

been read out

of

the repertoire of images that most

people bring to bear on their reality

and consequently the reality is the

spirited

the spirit resident in nature

is not visible when these mechanistic

grids are laid over it is sort of by a

kind of anticipatory osmosis we called

our company which has existed now 10

years or more Lux matura Lux Natura

means the light in nature the Luxe

matura is the salvational radiance that

can be found in the organic Kingdom it's

a term of paracelsus and it has slipped

from the grip of modern human beings

except in case special cases

where it is cultivated as in a

sensitivity or where it is pursued in

the guise of an aspect of the

Psychedelic experience

so

what is nature and what's so great about

it that it should be the center of the

mandala

well it seems to me that it is uh

exciting

in a way that has become occluded by the

perverse development of language

so that what we take to be exterior to

ourselves

and sustained by the laws of physics

which do not arise out of the human mind

is in fact not that at all but a kind of

stratum of expectation

that has been laid down by the human

Journey Through Time

now granted there are aspects of nature

which are not part of the human Journey

Through Time but they are a cult

from our point of view they are not

expressed except perhaps through the

Demonic artifice of an instrumentality

and this has been the

um

a course to the the strategy of science

is to use an instrumentality to reveal

the mechanics of the occult side of

nature the problem is that this occult

side of nature once

um explicated does not yield a

satisfying reflection of ourselves

it yields instead a very unflattering

reflection of ourselves if any at all

so you know in Hawaii sitting on the

Mountainside you think that you are like

Lenin in Germany or something and you

have to politically think it all through

so that uh to whatever degree one's

voice is heard mistakes are not made

because it seems to me clear that A

Small Miracle is taking place it is that

and I was saying this to uh to Roy today

it is that our point of view is actually

gaining ground

the thing which we least expected to

happen I think

that all this new age hustle and bustle

so granted that 95 of it is just

intellectual noise and efforts to that

fail efforts to coin The Perfect Analogy

that failed nevertheless there is a

residual five percent that appears to

have become The Cutting Edge Of The

Guiding image of this metaculture

um

so it becomes important then for people

who identify themselves with the human

potential movement Spiritual Development

The Rebirth of intuition all of these

things to make the place in the plan for

the role of Nature and different

responses have gone on to that the Gaia

response which claims nature as a

stabilizing feminine Force which I'm I'm

all for that I think that's definitely

the image that has to emerge that the

the recognition of the presence of

control mechanisms which are not

coercive but which are daoistic is a way

of coming to terms with nature

that we have resisted this is you know

it's a simple idea it's just the idea

that before technology uh people had to

store firewood for in the Autumn for the

winter and in the spring they had to

sharpen tools for the late spring

planting and this sort of thing that

there was an implicit rhythm

laid down by Nature that entered the

human Cosmos at every level and then was

reflected in the Poetry the culture

building the language Evolution accepted

and between urbanization

um other factors

removed the influence of these rhythms

ending in the final culmination of the

the modern city where life under

electric light built on 24 hours a day

there's been a flattening of the human

Dimension there is no more a sense of

being embedded in flux there is instead

the myth of the Eternal culture it's

like Woody Allen you know his comment

that he didn't like to go to the country

because you see all these screen doors

with cobwebs in the corners well

[Music]

you gotta come to terms with this guy

because

there is no question that that there is

a deepening ambiguity in the present

moment there is a

something

stealing over global civilization I

was at a conference recently where

someone proposed the notion that our

time is not special but there is nothing

unique about this moment other than that

it is presently occurring

I think nothing could be further from

the truth and that actually uh

the deepening ambiguity of the

historical experience which registers in

all of us as a sense of how weird it is

how compressed time is how complicated

the interconnections are is a real

phenomenon which eventually will be

elucidated in other words it will be

recognized as a phenomenon eventually

there is going to be a break with the

with the prevailing Paradigm of

historical process

in case you're not aware of it the

prevailing Paradigm of historical

process is descript is the one which

calls itself the trendlessly fluctuating

Theory

and it says we trendlessly fluctuate and

to search for a trend is to just be

drawn into a kind of cultural hysteria

the fact of the matter is that uh

standing outside the cultural hysteria

the trend is fairly clear it is a trend

toward temporal

compression and the emergence of

ambiguity how is it possible you know

you look at something like common ground

or even the shared Visions newsletter

and you say you know apparently the

major commodity moving on World Markets

is ambiguity the voices which whisper to

us from crystals herbs and Housewives

the uh the invisible fields from all

Dimensions which impinge upon us the

imagined histories and Futures which

intersect the present moment I mean if

all of these models or even a small

portion of them are given Credence then

the density of The Human Experience is

uh is considerably deeply I mean how

many past lives can you keep track of

how many extraterrestrial channels can

you have open before you begin to

realize that you know you're not living

in the kind of society like Mom and Dad

were used

so back to the theme of nature nature

anticipates all of this and anchors this

nature is actually the goal at the end

of History we're getting closer and

closer to the end of history and we will

not go past it with a moment of

blindness it is there will be vouch safe

intuitions about the emerging structure

of the others into which culture is

being subsumed you're all familiar with

the image of the oroboras the snake

which takes its tail in its mouth well

the end of History which you've heard me

talk about as as an archaic revival is

that's true an archaic revival but the

the ground of being in which the

original archaic Renaissance occurred it

was nature

so in terms of the expression of design

elements in terms of the expression of

Human

Relationships political agendas all of

these things the economies of nature are

going to set the guiding images it's

very interesting I read Stephen J

Gould's book biophilia in which he

describes his work with ants in Suriname

and how

um

there are ants which grow fungi in their

nests they chew up they cut leaves off

trees and chew them up into this MASH

which they then storing in rooms

underground and they bring the right

spores to it and grow it there and and

it produces the sugar which the ants men

eat and they tend the fungal Gardens

they actually remove foreign spores and

this sort of thing and the whole

symbiosis goes on well it's a symbiosis

between a social organism the ant and a

fungal organism which is able to provide

an enzyme sugar which drives the ant

Society to a greater state of activity

activity being the bottom line in an

insect economy where how much you can

get done determines your how well you

survive provided the triodes of getting

done are well established well this

provides

uh Curious analogy to the situation that

exists in human societies vis-a-vis

hallucinogenic plans

hallucinogenic plants uh

act as enzymes which stimulate

imagination

and Imagination

having a practical side to itself is

usually reconnected to this process in a

feedback loop that asks the question how

can we make more of the hallucinogenic

plant which is giving us all these great

ideas

so then you get initially the invention

of agriculture

and but one can't grow all plants in one

place as we learned even about Hawaii so

then uh the imagination the feedback

loop in the imagination driven by the

presence of the hallucinogen in the diet

asks the question how can we get the

plants that we can't grow and the answer

is networks of trade and systems of

barter and behind that lies the need for

language similar sorts of things these

kinds of symbiotic processes are

implicit in The Human Experience some of

you have heard another lecture I give

which goes into this in great detail

where I actually try to show that the

presence of

mushrooms in the dung of ungulate

animals on the belt of Africa 150 000

years ago

drove a set of processes which resulted

in self-reflecting human beings I won't

recapitulate that now except to say that

that process didn't end with the

invention of language or the

domestication of cattle it it continues

right up until the present day it really

is as though uh from a planetary point

of view what has happened is an enzyme

system called the human species was

deputized into an information gathering

mode sent out

as a kind of prodigal subsystem a kind

of episome of the social environment to

cognize the organization of the natural

world through a process called human

history or the historical advance of

understanding toward uh sufficiently

complete modeling of the ground but the

the closure could occur

and that is now I think what is

happening that the human species which

was deputized for Gaia into the fall

or fall into profane time the time of

non-participation in the immediacy of

the Dao through a series of successive

linguistic declensions that's what it

was I mean this begins to sound almost

biblical because what we're saying is

there's a fall

and then and the fall is somehow related

to a confusion of languages not one from

another but from the object of

experience and as the language became

less and less natural

the world

of the species using this language

became less and less natural because the

evolution of symbols became toward the

ABS move toward the abstract became the

realization of ideals notice that as

early as as platonic philosophy and I'm

not sure well no even in free Socratic

philosophy you get the enunciation of

abstractions great

overweening Concepts which subsume large

sets of particulars underneath them and

this this ability to subsume the

particulars under a name which is a

class name is the beginning of this

process of replacing the natural

language with the symbolic structures

that then interfere between

soul and nature the reason for for this

process we can really only guess that it

seems as though nature requires this

reflection upon itself that the

completion of nature is somehow in the

hands of a single Target species which

acts as an enzyme within the global uh

the global organism of Gaia from the

point of view of an extraterrestrial

looking down on the surface of the

planet there are not

uh discrete organisms there is simply a

gene swarm and through transmission of

viruses and numerous uh non-genetic ways

in which genes are transformed the

previously imagined sharp declensions

between species are actually somewhat

illusory so that really uh

that within the confines of my body the

unfolding of gene expression and the

molecular assembly of enzyme systems and

proteins and that sort of thing is

simply under a tighter regimen of

control than are the same kind of

processes which are going on between

people

we are really a Loosely regulated

organism that has a tendency to uh

ever tighten the control between its

subunits so that you can see the

evolution of language the evolution of

technology and it's being at the service

of media the rise of cities

the oral poetry all of these things we

seem to strive for greater and greater

cohesion greater and greater free flow

of thought among ourselves and what

we're looking toward

foreign

is a moment when the artificial language

structures which bind us within the

notion of ourselves are dissolved in the

presence of the realization that we are

a part of nature

and when that happens the childhood of

our species will pass away and we will

stand tremulously on the brink of really

the first moments of coherent human

civilization and when that happens the

noise which haunts our social systems

our inability to couple things together

so that they work will begin to

evaporate this I think is already

beginning to happen it's a slow process

but it's a kind of cascading phenomenon

such that once it begins to happen it

happens faster and faster and uh

the mirroring of psyche that was always

the

glamor if you will which stood behind

nature is

correctly perceived with greater and

greater clarity as this process proceeds

and this correct perceiving of of

Nature's relationship to self and

language is

the essence

of all of these cultural vectors that

are converging feminism the exploration

of space the Perfection of the thinking

machine or of the human machine

interface

the mysterium tremendum at the core of

the Psychedelic experience all of these

things are I think going to be seen as

anticipations of this post-historical

state which lies Beyond

um

the uh the working out of the themes

that have been set in motion by

materialistic science in other words the

forces that are being set in motion and

sustained by so-called new thought New

Age thinking this is why

because this seems to be happening

because it seems that we and by we I

mean all of us did in fact identify

early on a trend in society which is now

going to have enormous repercussions

that there is a responsibility to clear

thinking about what this thing is and

how it works there seems to be a kind of

a rush to get in line with the sloppiest

metaphor

as quickly as possible

so that you know and there have been a

number of let's say syncretic faiths or

new myths that have Arisen and competed

with each other with greater and lesser

degrees of success I suppose this is a

healthy thing except that it gives such

Comfort to the people who think we're

all AirHeads you know I mean they

observe all this and it confirms for

them that it's a hopeless loss

nevertheless

um

[Music]

so so I guess what I want to say about

that is that the everybody has their own

version of what is the mistake which is

being made right so here's my version of

what is the mistake that's being made

it's that there is a confusion between

scientific materialism and reason

science it has set itself up as a kind

of new pontificate

and Brooks no challenge it expects to uh

make judgment on any idea emerging from

any realm of human endeavor it has set

itself up as judge and jury the fact of

the matter is that this is only by

virtue of its spectacular acts of

technological prestidigitation that it's

able to uh

presume to do this

because really what science is most

successful about in telling us about are

Realms which none of us

have ever penetrated nor are ever likely

to

I mean how much do you wish to know

about the rings of Neptune or the the

quark

we're continuously sold the line that

somehow when the metaphors of

Consciousness are fully mapped onto

quantum physics and biology that they're

a great step forward will have been

taken it seems to me that since the

information coming out of quantum

physics and molecular biology is so

removed from the realm of common

experience that if we succeed in mapping

mental phenomena onto those Realms we

will have succeeded in the Final Act of

alienation because we will have at last

totally removed our experience of

ourselves from the realm of felt

cognition

so I think that instead of the idea that

there needs to be a kind of

direction of an overarching metaphor

from the physical sciences into the

social and psychiatric Sciences instead

there should be the recognition and

celebration of Mystery

that in fact we are an intelligent

species caught in a historical process

no generation which preceded us knew

what was going on and there is no reason

to assume that we know what's going on

or that the generation which follows us

will know what's going on and what kind

of trip is it Anyway to insist on

knowing what's going on

it's a highly unlikely Enterprise I mean

look at the data sample

the data sample is your lifetime on one

planet in one tiny corner of the

universe and from this via the fallacy

of induction certain principles of

uniformity are extended to the far-flung

corners of the cosmos in space and time

but then a bunch of fancy metaphors are

built up that nobody can check on anyway

and then this is called understanding

you see it isn't understanding

understanding

issues into appropriate activity

and you know a model of the universe

which doesn't issue into appropriate

activity in the Here and Now is a

curious model indeed after all

appropriate activity in the here and now

I would think would be the sine Quan

known everything else is um unconfirmed

rumor

so nature is the visible manifestation

of this mystery it entirely surrounds

and completes us it is there to be

beheld and imbibed in it is simply that

one must either replace the sterile

language of scientific materialism or

one must bring no language whatsoever to

it so that it speaks for itself

I've noticed with Ayahuasca this South

American Visionary Vine that Sahara

senegen unlike the mushroom it does not

speak it shows its language is visible a

fractal hieroglyphic surface of

intermediate Dimensions that contains an

endless unfolding a phenomena at level

after level apparently you know who

knows down into the microphysical realm

this is a correct seeing of what is the

the mystery is co-present with its

denial

it is a matter of changing points of

view

and changing points of view is a matter

of retooling language if nature is

psyche

then is being uh

Auto poetic

self-reflecting cloud and cognition that

manifests as language it is partly based

in the structure of matter it is partly

based in the implicit syntax of the

perceivers it is partly an interference

pattern between the two but it is as

close to the ground

that one can approach without a theory

which brings me then to the last point

that I want to make about this which is

the key to

be

forward

-looking expression of the archaic

revival the key to making the new age

fulfill its best hope and not fall into

a kind of

crypto fascism of paradigmatic warfare

is to enunciate

two principles which are really two ways

of saying the same thing they are the

Primacy of experience and the toxic

nature of ideology

these this to me is the core and if if

the new age the archaic revival whatever

if it can exemplify these two principles

we will navigate past the dangerous

Shoals that inevitably rip any social

point of view that grows that attempts

to leave its cult status and enter the

mainstream uh the Primacy of experience

means

I connect it to Heidegger's notion of

what he called care for the project of

being the Primacy of self-experience it

begins with a notion as simple as be

here now

but it takes that further and says you

know we must

take ourselves more seriously more

lightly and more seriously at the same

time we are not at the bottom of the

Pyramid of goods and information

production

where we pay the suckers price for

everything as it's handed down through a

series of intractable pieces of cultural

Machinery that we have no effect on that

is the myth that is being promulgated by

those very institutions the myths of the

hapless consumer the myth of the meaning

of fadism

but there is in fact a meaning to

switching from one ideology to another

ideology the way uh hemlines and

perfumes and and decorator colors come

and go this kind of allowing ourselves

to be self-victimized you know I mean

God forbid I'm now at an age where three

times in my life I've seen good ideas

emerging on the fringes of American

culture end up as slogans for Madison

Avenue you know first with the Beats

then with the hippies I'll never forget

the day I first confronted a billboard

which talked about the Dodge Rebellion I

mean rebellion was our word not their

word and here they were you know our

word selling this piece of tin junk so

you know the co-option that comes from

disempowering yourself with regard to

what you view as important which is more

important to you your opinion or uh or

uh Ted koppel's opinion it's got to be

your opinion you know because these

other things are just chimeras they're

they're myths in the electronic night

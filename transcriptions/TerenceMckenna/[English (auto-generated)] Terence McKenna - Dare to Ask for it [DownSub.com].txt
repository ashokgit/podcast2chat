foreign

t uh

some people like it uh it's a feeling is

what it's been for me it's this huge

feeling that kind of sweeps through you

and and it's velvety and it's

it's hard to describe actually but the

main thing that I'm noticing when it's

happening is I am not hallucinating and

of course the main thing that's

happening with DMT is you're having

hallucinations so intense so

three-dimensional so highly colored so

sculpturally defined that it's more real

than reality and by that I mean if you

look at this room notice how all edges

are slightly feathered there is at all

boundaries a slight indeterminacy

but on DMT it's hard edged everything is

just defined sometimes people say it's

as though all the air had been pumped

out of the room you're seeing it with

that lunar

starkness and Clarity you know and

unimaginable objects objects off the art

scale and uh

entities DMT is the only one of these

psychedelics where I have seen the empty

piece uh on psilocybin it speaks

and it's ideal on DMT

it's it's

um

you see these things

and uh

I don't know

whether it's my personal mythology for

me DMT is the center of the mystery I

mean I fear it I love it

I thank God for it uh I wonder if I'll

ever understand it it takes a huge

mustering of Courage on my part to do it

because I it just is so I mean we talk

talk talk talk talk talk

change transformation other dimensions

this is not talk when you do that I mean

you just do not know the parameters I

feel like I know more about what could

happen to me if I'm in the Amazon jungle

then I know what could happen to me when

I'm in that place and after many many

DMT trips I've finally been able to

paint a picture for myself of what is

happening in there and what happens for

me and I don't know anybody who's done

it as much as I have I wish people did

it more and talked more about it because

boy if there is a landscape where we

need some consensus this is it I have

uh been present when people did it and

they come back babbling about the same

thing that I think I have encountered I

mean they come back and and one woman

said

um

it was a carnival

it was a carnival of it was an

extraterrestrial Midway

and somebody else

came back and said there were there were

gnomes there were L's and yeah this is

getting close to it I mean what happens

to me when I do it is

um

foreign

there's a period an initial period of

kind of Hysteria and confusion it's

almost as though time speeds up even

before you take the first hit many

people say just before you do DMT

there's this funny kind of impression in

the room almost as though there is a

backwash from the event about to happen

you're caught in the in the in the

psychic field of this event and

everything is moving faster and faster

this is like the Q phenomenon and then

you take the hit and it's building up in

your body and your heart is pounding and

everything and then you break through to

this place and what it's like is there's

the first impression is of a loud well

the first impression is of the sound of

cellophane being crumpled that crackling

sound is this someone had just taken a

bread wrapper yeah

crackle that cellophane for us

that's it

more of that

are you there yet

wood that it were so easy

uh a friend of mine says that's the

sound of the radio intellecty of your

soul tearing out of the organic envelope

here

which is what it sounds like it sounds

like your body has just been wadded up

and thrown into a corner and now you're

a radio signal approximately four light

seconds in diameter spreading out

through an alien universe and this next

impression is of a cheer

it's

hurray welcome welcome and it's them and

they're waiting and they just they can

hardly wait I mean there's a moment when

they're not on me just a moment and then

they say you're here we're glad to see

you why did you stay away so long and

then they come toward me and the main

thing for me in the DMT thing is to

struggle not to go into shock

of Wonder basically I mean because there

is a tendency a strong tendency and for

the first few trips I couldn't conquer

it I was just I was a victim of it I

mean I just go into this

you know and I would say you know heart

heart okay breathing breathing okay and

I'm but I'm looking and I can't believe

my eyes because they're I'm in some kind

of domed place and the impression don't

ask me why but the impression is of

being underground even though it's a

huge vaulted space and uh highly colored

and then but what is of course riveting

my attention are these beings and

they're small

and they're like I've described them as

uh machine elves they seem partially

machine-like and partially elf-like

yeah no they are not so mundane as that

they don't have a fixed body outline and

in fact that's one of the things that's

going on in this space that's so

baffling they come toward you they're

singing in this alien language which you

somehow understand it cannot be

translated into English but you

understand it in that moment and what

they're doing is they are using their

voices to produce objects and so song

becomes thing and there are dozens of

these things and they're coming closer

and closer and the songs they sing can

dance into objects and the objects

themselves can sing

and and these things come in there

saying look look and they're holding

this stuff out to you and you look at it

and you're fighting Wonder because your

entire being is caught up in this can't

be happening and yet they're saying you

know just look and what it and what

these things are are

devices toys works of art objects but

whatever they are they are amazing and

you look into it and you can't and and

they seem to be shifting even though

they're made of metal and glass and gems

and pulses everything is migrating and

shifting and changing and they make they

say look at this one it's the most

astonishing thing you've ever seen and

you just look at it from and they say

look at this one look at this one and

they're piling up and these things are

coming towards you and then they jump

through you they can pass through your

body and they're running around chirping

and singing and making these objects and

what they're doing is they are saying do

what we are doing do what we are doing

and say

foreign

[Laughter]

and the implication is and I'm still

this is the mystery of my life I'm

teasing it out trying to understand it

but the implication is and the promise

is that ahead of us in time six months

50 000 years is a visible linguistic

channel of communication that the thin

channel of audio communication composed

of small mouth noises is just a

provisional kind of communication and

what is being proposed in this state is

a true telepathy now we always thought

or I always thought that telepathy means

you think I hear what you're thinking

what it actually turns out to be is you

speak I see what you mean

and I don't mean that metaphorically I

mean I see what you mean so that your

linguistic intentionality condenses as a

three-dimensional object in front of us

a sculptural modality so then we both

see what you mean you made it and I'm

your uh

conversational cohort and we're both

looking at your meaning and we can walk

around it we can adjust it and notice

that no common dictionary is necessary

here if you're witoto and I'm polish

I still see what you mean because what

you mean is an objectified

three-dimensional modality not a string

of witoto words

so that and and it's saying do this do

what we are doing well then I this took

me about 15 trips to get this far and

then I began to experiment with sounding

in that state and I discovered that they

were right that

um

is a three and a half foot wide eight

foot long magenta curved surface with

lime auras and that

um

shifts the line more as into rose pink

and adds gray silver pinstriping along

one Edge and I thought you know my God

what is this

so then when you break out into actual

chanting actually linguistically

modulated sound you discover you too can

make these objects and what they

apparently are

how this could be don't ask me they are

apparently a syntactical sculpture

sculpture made of syntax

syntax suddenly becomes not the rules

that govern spoken languages but the

rules that govern the Assembly of

three-dimensional thought objects and as

the words were the Shadows of

hyperdimensional intentions that can

actually be broken through to well my

God I just thought this is the weird

this take the cake I mean I've never

heard of such a thing nobody's ever

suggested to me this is possible so

forth and so on so then as is the case

with most things if you look long enough

you discover precursors

and what I discovered in a wonderful

book and any one of you would love this

book I'm sure it doesn't deal with the

Psychedelic experience by name but it is

a psychedelic book it's called the

phenomenon of Life by Hans Jonas

j-o-n-a-s

and if you can find this book what a

read it's a group of essays and one of

the essays he is talking about

[Music]

um

the etymology of the word Israel

and he says following talmudic

thinkers that Israel means he who sees

God that this is the actual etymological

basis of the word Israel so then

did I say that we're talking now about

the writings of Philo judeas yes Philo

judeas in discussing the etymology of

the word Israel says it means he who

sees God and then he says

what does this mean he who sees God

well as you probably know in the

Hellenistic World there was this

phenomenon called the logos and the

logos was an informing internal voice

that tells you the right way to live

it's like a spirit Ally that speaks to

you and informs you so Philo Judea said

what would be the more perfect logos

and then he goes on to answer his own

question he said The more perfect logos

would go from being heard to being

beheld without ever crossing over a

quantized moment of distinct transition

this is precisely and in fact what is

going on in in these states uh because

now I have learned or have found out how

to evoke this DMT phenomenon in a more

in the more controllable environment of

the psilocybin intoxication and it

happens like this first of all I form

the wish for it to happen I usually

follow a line I learned in an old I Love

Lucy rerun where she's explaining to

Ethel how she contacts flying saucers

and she says I just say come in little

green man come in little green men

so on mushrooms I do this I say come in

little green men and what begins to

happen is

this sound like Bells like very Distant

Bells and then it becomes louder and

louder it sort of like Bells with wind

and it becomes louder and louder and

more complicated and more complex and at

a certain very very hard to precisely

Define moment it begins to spill over

into the visual cortex and then I see

the language and I can I can interact

with it well it is apparently a more

perfect logos this is what I had in mind

in the back of my mind yesterday

remember when I talked about how smoking

was new to Europeans and they couldn't

understand what it was and then I made

this offhand comment that it was a new

use for the human body only 500 years

old well it proves that there may be

undiscovered uses for the human body I

mean we've only been around

playing with our bodies for fifty

thousand years and we've discovered most

sexual configurations and all these

acrobatic things and amazing things that

people can do like make pyramids of 10

individuals and so forth but smoking is

pretty basic and yet only 500 years old

well it seems to me that right under the

surface of human neurological

organization is a mode shift

some sort that would make language

beholdable

and that if we could somehow kick over

into this alternative mode we would

become unrecognizable to ourselves now I

realize this sounds pretty far-fetched

but you always have to have reference to

context

in a universe where there were no people

that would be a pretty far-fetched idea

but the fact that we already possess

language seems to argue that we are in

the process continually of evolving new

applications for our bodies and that

when language spoken language burst on

the scene 35

000 years ago which is most estimates I

mean think of it 35

000 years ago people invented language

what must it have seemed like to them it

must have seemed like a miracle what

hardly anything sets you up for it I

mean the difference between a nine hour

recitation of oral poetry and three

chickadees on a line is quite a leap and

I'm suggesting that somehow there could

be a leap forward in the communication

Dimension and that this is in fact what

Shamanism is all about what the end of

history is all about what psychedelic

drugs are all about we are Edge walking

on an ontological transformation of what

it means to be human

and the mode that this transformation

will come in it will not be political or

technological it is it isn't starflight

it isn't socialism it's a whole other

way of making our minds known to each

other by being able to show each other

our minds and in psychedelic States you

can do this yeah

is any relationship to the Australian

Aboriginal belief that the world that

the forefathers actually sung the world

in to be that the song and I hope that

concept doesn't seem too far off

that's right well yes as you say in our

own tradition in principio at verbum at

verbo carafactumest in the beginning was

the word and the Word was made flesh

that's the whole story what we need to

do is pass through this transition and

make the Word Flesh in other words

objectify the word somehow the work and

I believe me I know I talk about these

things but the pictures are provisional

I don't understand how it could be done

I mean I'm an engineering type on one

level is it an acoustical hologram

help in the world could I make you see a

concept in my mind

as though it were hovering three feet

above the floor is there a way and I've

noticed on psychedelics and again I I

don't know whether this is a false Trail

or whether this is part of the mystery

but I've noticed on psychedelics that

if you get it a candle

if you get a person between yourself and

a candle so that you have them in

profile and they are raving

and you can see the candle past them

there's something coming out of their

mouth

it's like

you know how when you agitate oil and

water and you see the swirling oiliness

of water or when you're in a swimming

pool with too much suntan lotion in it

there's this kind of roiling a

discontinuity in it that's fairly subtle

well something like that is the middle

of my field of vision and I'm just

watching them and they stop dead these

two people they must be 500 yards away

1500 feet away over these Rolling Green

Lawns they stop dead

and then they scan

and then they start toward me

and I cannot believe my eyes that these

people have changed course 90 degrees

and are now headed right for me and they

and I kept telling myself it's a

hallucination it's a loot an illusion

they are not getting larger in your

field of vision you are not going to

have to confront these people please God

make it so no reprieve they're just

getting larger and larger and larger

until and so I said I'm going to make

this go away by not looking and I'm just

going to sit like this and I sat like

this not moving until the guy's feet

entered my field of vision and then I

just and then I didn't move and I didn't

say anything and then I just looked up

and he said you are from which place

you have been now long in India and it

was the grilling which any Indian

tourist knows any citizen of the

subcontinent can approach you any time

of the day or night anywhere demand to

know your name how long you've been in

this country and then the kicker and

what do you think of India

and this question is asked for the

specific purpose of observing your

discomfort sure

because they know damn well what you

think of India and uh so

I I just I looked up and I gave this guy

my most penetrating gaze and I said

I cannot be interrogated and then I just

put my head down

and waited I don't know an hour and when

I looked up they were gone but uh only

in that circumstance of being so stoned

would I have ever behaved that way

because the normal tourist reaction is

and they watch this happen to you you

just go into a tail spin of it's their

country everybody's a person I'm a

stranger I should be nice they're

harmless what's so bad about this anyway

and then you know and so then you you

pair it out you explain I'm from San

Francisco California I've been here

three months so forth and so on

a friend of mine told me a funny story

about taking the Bombay Calcutta male

and arriving in Calcutta on this train

four o'clock in the morning and he gets

off the train and there's a little sadhu

man over there and the guy starts toward

him

and comes up to him and my friend said

wait a minute before you say a word my

name is Nathan Jones I'm from Brooklyn

New York I've been in India three and a

half months and I hate it and the guy

said oh you're a great Baba you're

reading my mind you're reading my mind

you've got to be fast that's all there

is to it yeah

the mushrooms against the creates its

own agenda you've also given example of

how you've directed it so which of those

is true and if you can direct other ways

to direct it to specific regions by

doing specific things

what kind of a region

well if you okay well the first thing is

do the mushrooms have their own agendas

and second of all if if you have some

control over it how do you get to where

you want to go

whether you want to deal with certain

issues like

death Resort the body or whatever or to

get to certain regions of communism

well it has its own agenda in that it

has this it has certain qualities this

extraterrestrial outer space

the planetary history is ending

apocalypse Millennia kind of thing you

can direct it if it likes the way you're

going it's sort of like a very a strong

horse you know if you're going the way

it wants to go you're fully in control

uh otherwise not

uh I mean I can remember situations with

mushrooms where I hadn't taken it for a

long time and I fall into confusion and

it usually revolves around am I doing

the right thing whatever the right thing

so then I'll take mushrooms and wait

until properly so and then put this

question am I doing the right thing and

it

reminds me of

a press conference that Lyndon Johnson

had once shortly after he became

president somebody asked a question but

he didn't care for and he said what kind

of a chicken question is that to

ask the president of the United States

so

when I go to the mushroom and say you

know am I doing the right thing it

basically said what kind of a chicken

 question is that to ask me

and I think that was a very good answer

that was what I needed to hear you know

and are you kidding

so you know it can be you know my father

used to say you can drive a horse to

water but a pencil must be led and I

think that that's sort of the situation

with the mushroom if the question

pleases it it will answer if the

question doesn't please it you'll you'll

hear about it and it it is amazing how

it gives people what they need you know

that rolling stone song you don't always

get what you want you get what you need

uh I have a friend dear friend but

arrogant no doubt about it this guy is

arrogant he definitely thinks he has his

the truth by the throat in most

situations and he won't take mushrooms

because it gives him such a hard time

I mean and it says you know you're

arrogant you want to know what we do to

arrogance people because for God's sake

lift it off me

so a certain amount of a certain amount

of humility it's a relationship like to

a crusty zen master or something like

that and it is really like another

entity because you cannot predict the

answers I mean I remember

a dialogue that I had with the mushroom

early on

where I said

what are you doing on this planet

and said uh you're a mushroom you live

cheap

listen this neighborhood was not so bad

till the monkeys moved in

for you it may look like a mess to me it

was Paradise

the mushroom is very very weird I I'll

tell One More Story then I'll try and

get off stories but and all these

stories why am I doing all these uh

dialogue

but why am I doing all these ethnic

imitations I'm not sure there's one in

this story too I was in Malibu with all

these fancy film people and we went out

to dinner Ralph Abraham was there too

and there was this French woman there a

film producer and she was seated next to

me at dinner and before dinner we had

been uh

where I had been introduced to her as

the Mushroom Man and this and that and

she said to me

um

and you'll see why the story I just told

relates to this the story about you're a

mushroom you live cheap

and she said to me at dinner she said

you say that the mushroom speaks to you

but I do not understand exactly how this

works and I said well

it's sort of like uh uh it has many

faces that it can show like sometimes

it's like the role that Rod Steiger

played and the pawn broker

and at that precise instant

Steiger shows up at the table to shake

hands with everybody and slap a few

backs and then he just drifts us into

the recesses of this restaurant and

Ralph Abraham who was sitting across the

table from me watching this whole thing

and had heard what I said to this woman

reached across the table to me and said

you see the mushroom is showing us that

it can touch us anywhere anytime

strange stories synchronicity

yeah

yeah how do you remember to bring back

what you've learned oh that's a good

question that's a that's an important

question that's a key question

um

Roland Fisher who was a great

psychedelic researcher with psilocybin

and later retired to Majorca

to be Robert Graves next door neighbor

coined the phrase State bounded this

means you can't bring it back and I'm

sure you all have had the experience of

dreaming being caught up in some

incredible dream with strange people

foreign countries exotic costuming the

alarm goes off and as you stagger out of

bed this is just melting like an ice

cube in a blast furnace and by the time

you're out of bed and fully dressed you

have nothing not a shred not a hint not

a clue it's absolutely gone this is a

state-bounded memory chemically what's

going on is apparently short-term memory

transcription is just not occurring

you're having the immediate impression

of these things happening and then it's

not it's not going to disc so to speak

it just is law

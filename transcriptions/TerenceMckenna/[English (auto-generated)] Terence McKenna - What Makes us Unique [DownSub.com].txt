foreign

a domain of human endeavor that isn't

impacted by the imagination

I mean teasing the imagination apart

from the Talking Monkey is not an easy

thing to do imagining ourselves without

imagination is itself a paradox

uh

and yet you know what is it

and and why is it if you take the view

that uh biology does nothing in vain and

evolutionary economics are incredibly

spare

then why have this faculty that allows

one to command and manipulate realities

which do not exist

I mean that's in my mind the basic

function of the imagination some people

might argue and say well for most people

the imagination is the coordination of

mundane data in other words if I work

this hard and if I have this much money

can I afford that car

to my mind this is not putting great

pressure on the human imagination

uh the human imagination as I

uh suppose it is uh

almost an extension of the visual

faculty

uh imagination is something that one

behold

something that takes people speak of

castles in the air or something like

that

uh

one idea that is

worth entertaining because it is

entertaining not necessarily because

it's the truth

but is the idea that the imagination is

actually a kind of window onto realities

not present

in other words it's very clear from an

evolutionary point of view that our our

body and our sensory perceptors are

organized in such a way as to protect us

to to warn of danger to give you the

muscles to respond to that danger when

it comes the imagination

it doesn't seem to work quite like that

if the imagination runs riot in the

dimension of the mundane it's paranoia

in other words if you believe every cop

on the corner is looking at you every

chance heard comment is about you the

imagination is in that situation

pathological it is taking the raw data

of experience and giving it a

maladaptive

spin

so then uh

where is the imagination appropriate

and it seems that it is most appropriate

in the domain of human uh creativity

that in fact separating art from

imagination is simply the the exercise

of separating uh cause from the fact

art sculpture poetry painting dance is

is like the footprints of where the

imagination has been

and you know the abstract expressionists

uh Paula particularly always insisted

that a painting a Pollock

is not

what the process is about the process is

about making

being Pollock The Act of Creation what

the rest of us are then left with is a

husk

a tracing uh something left behind which

says

imagination was here

imagination

acted in this place and this is this is

what is left

uh

uh a very interesting thing that's going

on in physics at the moment is and I

don't want to spend too much time on

this because it's slightly off subject

although it certainly is fascinating the

great bridge between Art and Science

that was supposedly built in the 20th

century hinged on this thing called the

uncertainty principle uh it was the idea

that as you know more and more things

about certain aspects of a system an

atomic system in this case certain other

parts that lose focus and become less

and less clear for example if you know

velocity you don't know position as you

hone in on exact position

velocity becomes smeared out and

probably more ink and more breastfeeding

has been shed over this aspect of modern

physics than any others now to the great

embarrassment of all the people who held

workshops and wrote books and

pontificated on this matter it appears

that this is what it always looked like

fuzzy and confused thinking

and that

the Heisenberg uncertainty principle or

rather the Heisenberg formulation of the

quantum theory

is uh now not to be preferred the

preferred understanding now is the

version of quantum theory formulated by

David Bowen the difference between these

two theories mathematically is precisely

zero

there is no difference

but they make different assumptions

and the reason originally the Heisenberg

formulation was preferred was because it

was felt that this uncertainty principle

which was a hard swallow was not as hard

to swallow as a piece of baggage which

the boem theory carried embedded in it

and that piece of baggage was called

non-locality

the two theories produced identical

mathematical descriptions of nature but

one had this uncertainty principle in it

the other had built into it non-locality

non-locality is the idea that any two

particles that have been associated with

each other in the past

retain

across space and time a kind of uh

connectivity

such that if you are if you change a

physical aspect of one of these

particles the law of the conservation of

parity will cause the other particle to

also undergo a change at the exact same

moment even though they may by now be

separated by millions of light years of

space and time this was thought to be so

counter-intuitive so Preposterous that

the Heisenberg uncertainty principle was

was chosen as the lesser of two evils

but it turns out over the past 10 years

experiments have been done in the

laboratory not thought experiments

actual apparatus experiments which

secure that non-locality actually is

real

there is

below the ordinary surface of space and

time ruled by relativistic physics there

is this strange domain of instantaneous

connectivity of all matter of all

phenomena

it raises the possibility then

that the imagination

is in fact a kind of uh organ of

perception

not an organ of creative

uh

unfoldment but actually an organ of

perception and that what is perceived in

the imagination is that which is not

multiple

and never can be

so uh I I myself am up in the air about

this or as you get to know me better you

will see I don't feel the need to

believe or disbelieve to Proclaim this

true or untrue but it is useful at this

stage for understanding

our mental life

uh

I've spent a lot of time

talking to people and thinking about the

origins of consciousness

and in one sense asking the question

what is the imagination

is a different way of asking the same

question what is the origin of

consciousness

and as some of you know to

ex distraction I believe that psilocybin

mushrooms played a role kick-starting

human evolution I don't want to repeat

all that here it's been taped many times

but

um what I want to point out is that we

can see in nature I think the uh

declension

from the full

blown human imaginative capacity back

into the organization of the animal mind

we can see the stages

through which this must have unfolded

the interesting animal to look at in all

of this for the moment are the top

carnivores

this is not PC in a vegan environment

but a thought just has to lead you

wherever it leads you

it's very clear to me that top

carnivores

coordinate data in the environment of

very judiciously

cows

have very little to say about grass

but cats hunting cats have a great deal

to say about their diet because a top

carnivore to be successful must in a

certain sense think like it's prey

and so at the very point of the

emergence of these coordinated

strategies held in the mind there's a

paradox the earliest consciousness

is consciousness which Apes other

consciousness

in other words the top carnivore that is

most successful is the carnivore that

can think most like a weasel or a

groundhog or a rabbit because this

ability to think like the prey gives you

a leg up on the prey and if you've ever

seen not domestic cats that

small jungle hunting cats or Jaguars or

something like that in the sudden

presence of a chicken a hundred feet

away or something they fall into a fit

of imagining because they can almost

taste they probably can taste it and

they fall into a strategic mode

that is clearly an intense state of

imagining but it is triggered by uh the

presence of the prey

what is interesting about human beings

is we went One Step Beyond that we for

reasons which don't need to concern us

here acquired the ability

to

strategically

suppose not in the presence of the

stimulus but in fact back in the back of

the cave around the fire with our

bellies full

telling tall tales

and it's interesting that the

imagination is the land of what if

and what if

is a kind is is almost like a statement

in a computer language it

is a Boolean operator if you know what I

mean

uh

breaks the flow of reality into two

possibilities if a or b or more

and uh this ability to contemplate

worlds which are only in potentia

is the basis of the imagination and I

would submit to you since we all are

sitting here in Monkey bodies that it's

pretty clear that the stimulus for all

this gift thinking uh comes in two forms

uh

uh food and sex

in other words we think about what we

are going to eat we construct our

Behavior along an if tree if I go to the

water hole if I take my sharpened arrows

if I lie in wait if the gods favor me I

will bring down dinner

the sexual game is played the same way

if I approach the desirable female with

the correct offerings if her mood is

correct if my gifts are found pleasing

then some wonderful thing will follow

from all of this so

animals I don't think think

like this they may think but they don't

think like this

it seems to be a unique human ability

that

probably has to do with as I say

in our case there were many different

factors for example we became the top

carnivore on the planet but who would

have placed their bat

on on a monkey to be the top carnivore

when there were saber-toothed cats

walking around that weighed 1100 pounds

how were we able to insinuate ourselves

into a more powerful position than these

enormously powerful animals that we once

shared the Earth with and that in fact

we hunted to Extinction it's our

destiny and Our Fate to have removed the

so-called megafauna from this planet it

it is now generally agreed by

paleontologists that The Disappearance

of the megafauna and the appearance of

the human beings are are linked in time

well we did this by imitating

those carnivores and imitation is an act

of the imagination we like in our story

about ourselves to think of ourselves as

bold Hunters

but the The evolutionary truth of the

matter is probably that as the first

wave of primate radiation into the

grassland occurred as the diet was in

transition we were scavengers of caring

we were not Noble Hunters bringing down

Mighty animals we followed along behind

lions

lion kills there's one school of

evolutionary theory that believes this

is why our all the factory senses are so

diminished because quite frankly we had

our face in rotten meat for a million

years

and if that doesn't dull your appetite

for Keen smells uh nothing will least

you despair I'll tell you that there's a

counter Theory which says no no we lost

our sense of smell when we stood up

right because it lifted our face off the

ground

in either case there seems to be the

idea that when you get away from the

olfactory action the the energy to

support the maintenance of that sense

collapses

for whatever reason

we made our way to the brink of the

imagination in other words I don't think

we require a deus ex machina to to take

ourselves to the position of being top

carnivore on the planet we have a mean

throwing arm

and you know you may notice no animal

throws things the way we do

other primates hurl excrement down on

agonized explorers but fortunately not

with great accuracy and anyway that

particularly material is rarely deadly

anyway but a human being for example a

big league baseball pitcher can at 125

miles an hour put a baseball across a

17-inch plate over and over again one

theory of the origin of Consciousness

wants to say that throwing something

is an interesting action

activity because though it may appear to

be the same activity as digging grubs or

scratching your ass or something like

that in fact it requires coordination

toward a future outcome

that is highly mathematical in other

words you may not think in numbers but

you must somehow sense the concept of

trajectory coordination of Target and

intent and when you get all this up and

running

According to some people you have enough

brain power left over to write the Fifth

Symphony invent quantum physics and

paint to the last supper if you like

this seems preposterous to me I think

that

how the imagination got such a hold on

us was that we accepted into our diet

catalyst

that we were unaware of that pushed our

mental state around uh specifically

psychedelics of various sorts and a

reasonable working definition of

psychedelics what they do whether you're

for it or again it whether you think it

triggers paranoia or or

ataraxia

they are catalysts for the imagination

they catalicize thought they they

thought becomes more Baroque it reaches

deeper into reality for data it sees

forms of connectivity that previously

escaped it it makes assumption leaps

assumption not always correct but

sometimes

correct so what it does is by uh to some

degree transferring chaos

into the mental World it creates a much

richer dynamic

and

and so thought processes become more

complicated and in a sense then uh

language

becomes the behavior

which expresses the imagination uh it it

can be expressed

in The Limited form through dance

through gesture and of course it can be

expressed very well through painting if

you've reached the stage where you have

painting and are not chipping rock or or

drawing and blood in the sand or

something like that but if you have

really a rich

technology behind your artistic intent

but that rich technology would never

have Arisen without the intercession of

language and so these two things which

make us unique among

Nature's Productions on this planet

imagination and language seem to be

almost like the exterior and interior

manifestation of the same

thing the same phenomenon and what it is

is it's a

facility with data

an ability to connect it in novel ways

uh for one's own entertainment and

amusement if nothing else

storytelling

is obvious

this kind of activity where modules a

ghost a princess a lost kingdom a a

disturbed father-son relationship these

modules are manipulated to entertain

people and you know it's a cliche that

there are only five stories

I think Robert Graves in the white

goddess argued there's only one story

and we keep telling variants of this

story over and over again

well uh the what history then is or what

culture is is

um the the phenomenon that attends the

rise and spread of the imagination in

the human species

but because

the imagination works on this what if

model

it always tends toward

idealism

in other words it it is not simply uh

a networked process it's a networked

process with a vector field in other

words it's going

somewhere it's not just a random walk

it's headed somewhere we idealize

if you're going to play the game what if

most people

who are psychologically healthy don't

sit around entertaining dire

possibilities what if

I get a terrible disease what if I'm run

over by a truck no people say what if I

make a lot of money what if I meet

somebody who gives me a lot of money and

it you know it begins to tend toward

idealism

and we are obviously uh ruled by ideals

and ideas

uh we haven't found a good one yet but

we certainly have sacrificed a lot of

blood and time in the process of

discovering a whole bunch of bad ideas

and we haven't lost our faith in ideas

even though human history is the record

not one idea

has survived from the distant past in

its original form

and some of the most persistent ideas I

would argue are some of the most

pernicious ideas I mean the idea of

man's inherent

uh

flaw that's an old old idea and how much

suffering has existed because of it uh

but culture then is the record of the

human imagination well that's fine that

is of interest to anthropologists and

somebody else who knows what gives the

whole thing a lot of bite

is that

more and more the imagination is where

we spend our time

uh

you know there's a lot of talk these

days about virtual reality a an

immersive state-of-the-art technology in

which you put on goggles and special

clothing or inter-special environments

and then you are in artificial worlds

created by computers and this is thought

to be very woo-woo and far out

but in fact if you're paying attention

we've been living inside virtual

realities for about ten thousand years I

mean what is a city

but a complete denial of Nature and say

no no not trees mud holes waterfalls and

all that

straight lines

laid out roads uh class hierarchies

reflected in local geography meaning the

rich people live here surrounded by the

not so rich people all served by the

poor people who are so glad they're not

the outcast before

so uh you know urbanization is

essentially the first of these impulses

where Society leaves nature and enters

into its own private Idaho

uh and the the growth of cities and the

growth of the uh

uh immediacy I guess you would say of

the urban experience has been a constant

of human evolution since urbanization

began uh now the only difference that

the new technologies offer is we are

going to do this with light not mortar

brick steel aluminum and titanium which

are incredibly intractable

materials I mean it's it's amazing to me

we started with the toughest stuff ah

and

and of course it cost enormous amounts

of human blood and treasure to work with

such intractable materials it's always

been amazing to me that the largest

buildings human beings ever built

are in a sense the first buildings human

beings ever built because the pyramids

of Egypt are enormous even by modern

scale and yet they were among the

earliest buildings uh ever built in

virtual reality the difference between a

hundred story building and a 10-story

building is one zero

that's all in a line of code you specify

100 over 10 and you get a hundred story

building instead of a 10 story building

uh what this should tell us is that in

the domain of light

the intractability of matter is overcome

and so we are on the brink of a time we

are we have arrived we are at the time

where the human imagination now need

meat no

barriers to its intent

and so we are going to find out

Who We Are

we are going to

discover what it means to be human when

there is no resistance

to human will

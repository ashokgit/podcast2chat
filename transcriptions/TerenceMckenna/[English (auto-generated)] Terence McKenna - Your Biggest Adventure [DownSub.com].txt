foreign

obviously when you evolve inside an

animal body localized in space and time

you get a hellacious set of reflexes and

muscles designed to deal with immediate

threat in the environment

but at the core of the oyster is you

know this portal into universalism

which we have denigrated to what we call

the imagination uh it it is a PR it is

there is a third eye the third eye

exists but it doesn't look out at this

world you've got two perfectly good eyes

for doing that the third eye

looks out at the holographic matrix of

informational totality and then the

problem for that form of perception is

uh

filtering

well Atman means

Soul or being or yes I mean it's simply

that Consciousness is distributed and

holographic and nobody has their brand

on it what we have been calling human

consciousness is the only Consciousness

there is

uh it's something you tap into not

something you evolve out of yourself I

mean you

you required a local language to

create a local model of this Universal

input if your local language is

insufficient then you abide in a in the

domain of intuition

and I would that's what I would call

animal Consciousness it's a domain of

intuition of of being

animals Intuit being but

given a more advanced nervous system a

more advanced cultural toolkit

the intuition changes into a a direct

perception and you begin to make poetry

and experience loss and feel love and

and you begin to feel the emotional

outlines of the Enterprise

of being and how far one can go into

that I assume it's infinite or at least

appears infinite from our limited

position so the local languages

well the local languages is a necessary

compromise it would be in its

interesting uh

the thing that makes psychedelics so

Central to a discussion like this is

they are the only thing which pulls the

plug on the illusion

the illusion created by local language

that's why people are both in love with

it and terrified of it because it

addresses a fundamental aspect of

reality and IT addresses it

incontrovertibly and people who feel

culture as a safety zone that is keeping

at Bay the black oceans of God knows

what are not interested in taking

psychedelics on the other hand people

who feel confined by the cultural dream

and who want to cross the black oceans

of who knows what to see what's on the

other side they Embrace that same

experience as a god-sent gift but it's

the same phenomenon so it IT addresses

you know

one's own fundamental relationship to

the unknown local languages like local

cultures and Architectural Styles and

everything else are designed to create I

think an a

a

an infantile sense of security

one of the bees up my rear end these

days is the idea that culture is not

our friend

that we have been very naive about uh

about what culture is and how it is

something designed for the convenience

of the species

and you know it could turn you into a

janitor or a banker or a celebrity or

anything else with no interest or

concern for whether that's good for you

it plays with individuals and uh you

know most people think or at least here

I think most people think that when you

get to be I don't know 30 35 40 or

something you have jumped all the

hurdles you've got your college degree

you had some children you made some

money you lost some money maybe you had

a marriage maybe you had several and

anyway people sort of get the feeling

well I've I've done it actually the

major Adventure

still lies ahead and the major Adventure

is to claim your authentic true being

which is not culturally given to you

the culture will not explain to you how

to be a real human being it will tell

you how to be Banker politician Indian

chief masseuse actress whatever but it

will not give you true being and maybe

this is the voice of somebody who just

turned 50 talking but uh that I thought

it would get simpler it doesn't because

this rejection of culture thing

is is the last and hardest

step to take and there are all kinds of

impediments to taking it the fact that

in middle age if you've played the game

right you get a lot of money

that's totally stultifying in most cases

in terms of going forward to the next

level it's almost as though culture is

an Enterprise

self-organized to buy you off at the

moment when you might be most dangerous

to its values and goals

well you know in in Revelation

the the Ancient of Days is described as

uh there's a a sword which comes out of

the mouth it's a very hard image to

picture but a sword the Turning sword

which comes out of the mouth

uh and of course the whole Western myth

of creation is a the world was made by

an utterance in principio adverbum at

verbocarafectomast in the beginning was

the word and the Word was made flesh

and in some sense I think the the what

is not stated there is that then out of

the flesh the word must be redistilled

that's the second half of the historical

process uh

in this book which I may mention at some

point the statement is made God created

man in order to taste the bitter fruit

of time

uh in the DMT Flash

the this the entities that appear

their entire

program is a program of language

acquisition and you know this is a point

that's brushed over in science fiction

films because it's actually such a

conundrum those of you who saw and you

suffered as I did uh Mars Attacks uh the

the little role for Rod Steiger in there

as the German guy with the translation

machine well if you think about alien

contact real alien contact we cannot

assume that Universal understanding is

easily achieved the very first aspect of

true alien contact would probably be a

language lesson of some sort because the

aliens don't want to communicate about

our gross national product or our

political system if they do they're not

really aliens they're just odd looking

people from far away

real aliens have something really alien

to communicate and it can only be

communicated in an alien language so I

think it's very suggestive that these

you invisible entities that we contact

when we dissolve the local language

boundaries and they are they're like mud

walls built around our little Hut of

mental you know our collection of goats

and stuff that we've pushed together and

then we dissolve the walls and you know

there's alien people there's alien Minds

out there waiting to trade with us they

probably have always been trading with

individual Geniuses through dream

through Insight through imagination I

mean many of you know if you've read

Thomas kuhn's book the structure of

scientific revolutions you know that

even in as constipated and

self-conscious and Enterprise as science

the real breakthroughs occur in

situations of delirium Frenzy

drunkenness inspiration and then guys

usually it's guys spend the whole rest

of their professional life trying to

make it all sound reasonable and

rational and how it proceeded from

earlier work done by other people and so

forth and so on this is just a fantasy a

kind of way of attaining respectability

well yeah I mean Hinduism and Hebrew and

I think those are the two biggies have

really elaborate theories of the power

and the Tran and the the place in the

Universal scheme of things of certain

tones and and and

it's as I was sitting I was thinking

Sufi and then I was also thinking

Pythagorean I mean some people call this

the Pythagorean impulse the belief that

basically the universe is harmonious

and exists as a series of octaves and

that if you know the mechanics of this

you can converse with angels you can

Ascend to higher levels uh

yes again it's an issue of language I

mean some languages fill your pockets

with lead and some languages you know

give you a helium balloon for plunging

into these metaphysical areas

one thing I wanted to talk about this

morning and maybe this is the place to

get into it is we've spoken of the

imagination as a seemingly boundless

Realm

but it's not rule

and if people who who encounter it

without rules

often have very difficult experiences

the most difficult of which can be

raving Madness I would think and so if

we're going to embrace the imagination

as the new Benchmark of uh of being then

we need to talk about what what

the rules are that obtain in the

imagination you know the 14th century

nominalist William mavacum dealt with

questions like

can God do anything yes God can do

anything then can God make a rock so

heavy that God can't pick it up

and then if not why not and and what

does this mean well this is an effort to

tame

the imagination and Occam concluded from

exercises like that that even God must

follow the rules of logical necessity

otherwise becoming trapped in

self-negating uh paradox

so I I am thinking about this I listed

three

uh areas where rules might be gleaned

that could be applied to the imagination

uh

the the first two are linked somehow uh

mathematics

uh mathematics is not what you think it

is

mathematics is basically a rational

thinking about defined sets of entities

and since the imagination is nothing but

defined sin sets of entities the rules

which govern them uh are worth learning

in Practical terms what this comes down

to is uh logic

and one of the problems that I think

haunts the current cultural empath is

the fact that there is a lot of

hostility to science

and it has spilled oh and science we

should be very suspicious of it's a it's

a wonder worker it's a magician dealing

its Wares in the marketplace

so we should be suspicious of science

but this

a scientistic paranoia has spilled over

into a suspicion of reason

this is too much

if you abandon reason you will have

nothing to guide you but the emotional

depth of the situation this is what

Heidegger called the depth of the call

and in the 20th century the history of

following uh the depth of the call has

not been a happy one we cannot trust the

call of the blood on critique by reason

a reason is primary in this situation

well so then many people say well

mathematics is impossible logic is

difficult isn't there a third

possibility isn't there yet another way

to get a handle on this and the answer

is yes but I'm not sure it's easier it

may seem at first easier but that is uh

Aesthetics

the imagination must

serve the ideal of the beautiful this is

I talked about this a little bit uh last

night uh the the uh that which is

tasteless

is to be avoided at all costs and ninety

percent of the difficulty in your

intellectual life would never have

happened if you had just had better

taste

am I not right

you know uh I I look at this Heaven's

Gate thing in amazement

because of its tastelessness

that's all I mean uh it is utterly

unappealing for that reason I don't even

have to reach for the club of logic uh

if it had been battered scripted I might

need logic but the Aesthetics of the

situation are just so overwhelmingly ugh

the suicide cult that eliminated itself

in San Diego yeah

and I'm going to get off the subject

well usually I mean usually people ask

me what will happen in 2012 and I say

it's like asking a man Facing East at 2

am what will sunrise look like in other

words it's too early to ask

well I think that a I don't have an

answer to the problem of the bully and

the slave unless

as the marxist's claim that is

inimical

to disparity of wealth

because I think disparity of wealth is a

transient phenomenon

uh based on a limited technology but it

is entirely possible that we can make

everyone a king and we will still have

bullies and to Slaves so if the marxists

are wrong and the addressing of the

economic disparity doesn't change the

structure of the human soul then

we will have to go deeper and I don't

know how this is going to look there's a

lot of tension in any community that

discusses this kind of stuff

over what where the body lies in all of

this can we solve our problems and

maintain our individual existences or

are we about to are we in fact furiously

building a level of hierarchical control

above the level of the individual that

that will make things like States and

corporations seem like pale soup indeed

are we in fact trying to create a super

organism what is the relationship of an

idea like that to Classic fascism

well

what about the internet you mean is it

the coming of the super organism it is

prosthesis on an incredible scale it is

going to Define to redefine what it is

to be human I I think Technologies are

neither Gods nor demons it's what you do

with it

The Dilemma of human freedom is that we

don't know

we don't know where we rest in the

Universal hierarchy of Good and Evil in

other words what would we do if we could

do anything would our Transcendent

impulses drive us to a kind of angelhood

or as James Joyce says would we flop on

the scenery side

and and the answer normally given is

some would do one and some the other

yes but what if we erase that

possibility of individual action and is

there then only one destiny and then

what shall it be and who shall uh decide

uh I would be fairly pessimistic if I

saw this all going on on a level

playing field but it isn't going on on

11 Level Playing Field uh Transcendence

is favored

nature is seems to be in the business of

Building Systems which transcend

themselves we can see that as far back

in time as we care to look and

throughout all of nature so it seems

like we actually have a hell of a

Tailwind helping us toward the

Transcendent other probably that is what

will make the difference we couldn't

have done it by ourselves but we happen

to be in a universe which is itself

involved in the process of

bootstrapping to higher levels

yeah

well it traditionally meaning since the

invention of print the artist has had

this role where the eccentricity and the

Bohemian lifestyle and so forth of the

artist was tolerated because the

argument was the artist is a kind of

antenna for this mysterious thing called

the future and and the artist would

sound the alarm and bring the news in a

sense we don't hear this kind of talk

anymore because this is the future you

know we have become the very thing our

parents warned us against

uh we'd we those cheerful dreams of

endless progressivism that's built up

the 19th century and early 20th century

have given way to a much more cynical

and sophisticated understanding that we

may our buildings may become taller our

automobile shinier but somehow the the

human animal is not moving forward uh at

the same rate as our technology uh

so what we have to do then is give

people opportunities and let the devil

take behind most at least create a world

where those who aspire to Transcendence

are not blocked in the aspiration and of

course it's not

it's not that some of us are these pure

aspirants and others the hunters of the

sleazy side of the internet we each play

all these roles and move in between them

according to taste and mood I mean one

of the great falsities of

print is is the making illegitimate of

schizophrenia I mean we are all just

swarms of personalities the idea that a

healthy person has a unified identity is

just a silly idea it's like believing

that sexual preference comes in only two

flavors or something it's one of those

incredibly weird simplifications that

once made everybody lines up in salutes

no matter how much Agony it causes every

individuals yeah

well last night what I said was that I

was a platonist

and that Plato felt that the that the

world was approached through three

paths the good the true and the

Beautiful but that goodness is

controversial and Truth difficult to

discern but that Beauty has a kind of

resonant self-evidence

and so following Beauty

it's my faith will lead to the good and

the true

and some beauty is I mean I'm a fan of

extreme forms of beauty uh Hieronymus

Bosch and redone and James or I mean the

beautiful can be grotesque of course

this then opens up a

a whole aesthetic can of worms that

maybe we don't want to get into

um

well beautiful Art Is Never bad

but I mean yes I think grotesque the

beauty of the grotesque is the unique

modern contribution to the discussion of

beauty we and and it's a higher form of

perception I mean it's all very fine to

find beauty in wildflowers and women

dancing and diaphanous dresses and

harpsichord music and it's quite another

to find beauty and ripped up Railway

tickets and found objects and smashed

machinery and and that sort of thing the

modern sensibility has been

unsentimental

and has in that sense I think Advanced

the Canon of beauty

modernity I'm feeling much better about

now that it's over

no it's such a huge Enterprise to look

back on you know I mean

what faith what Simplicity what uh

naivete those people possess to

I can hardly get over it the 20th

century for all of its brutality and

it's uh it's uh

flirtation with the the dark side of the

human soul the Counterpoint to that was

its incredible optimism and idealism and

it and simplicity I mean the Simplicity

of fascism the Simplicity of Marxism the

Simplicity of democratic political

Theory I mean these are idea ideologies

that it clearly never met a human being

[Laughter]

well the idea of an attractor uh this

you see

these huge

thought structures that we live inside

that we're not even aware of and one of

them is is the idea that uh

causes precede their effects

we this seems like a non-statement to

most people of course causes precede

effect

but in fact uh processes if causes

always precede to defects then many many

processes would be in unpredictable that

are in fact predictable and this has to

do with this word we've introduced last

night briefly the Creole the Ronald a

given process the destiny of the people

or the evolution of a political system

or the growth of a series of

interconnected scientific ideas is not

in fact free to develop in any direction

it wants it is going on in an epigenetic

environment of of intellectual

confinement of some sort and in the same

way that water runs downhill a given

idea developing in a given time and

place will predictably develop in a

certain direction

one of the very large creods that we can

see at work in nature and Society is

what I call the conquest of

dimensionality

uh

biology

is a strategy for

moving into and occupying ever more

dimensions

and biology begins as a point like

chemical replicating system attached to

a primordial clay and a proverbial warm

Pond somewhere at the dawn of time and

as life develops it folds itself

it becomes a three-dimensional object it

replicates itself in time by that means

it claims the temporal Dimension after a

two or three billion years of that it

has evolved itself to the point where

with strong muscles it can move through

space with superb visual organs it can

coordinate its exterior environment and

finally through the Advent of language

it can tell its story it can move

information around not present and as

soon as you begin to code that

information into stone or magnetic

medium or whatever

in a sense time has stopped you are

moving outward now and this very large

Creole seems to inform not only biology

but the human Enterprise as well so when

I talk about stuff like the evolution of

photo lithography and moving pictures

out of Photography and the evolution of

surround sound and the global

Airline system and these kinds of things

these are Dimension conquering phenomena

designed to shrink the Earth to a point

and of course the internet is the mother

of all

dimensional Conquest I mean in a single

40-minute session on the internet I may

talk to computers in Helsinki Australia

Paris

you name it and I don't even notice that

this has happened yeah it doesn't matter

it's meaningless

to think in those terms because in fact

you might as well think of it all being

inside your CPU sitting on your desk it

has the same effect and and what that is

is it's the sum total of human knowledge

being daily augmented and the Fury with

which people put their thing on the

internet everything from you know how

Grandma's recovering from her stroke to

uh I visited the language site the other

night that had

122 syllabuses for 122 languages that

were philological engines for searching

these languages I got there through the

Vonage manuscript site yes that all

still goes on

that Community is at work so apparently

we will not rest until all space and all

time is brought down into

for all practical purposes a single

point

and this is an idea that has been around

in various forms since at least the 16th

century I mean it's the alchemical idea

of the Philosopher's Stone a universal

Panacea a medicine which makes you wise

Immortal

All-Seeing all-knowing all good

but interestingly conceived as an

artifact of Technology conceived as

something brought into being through the

effort of a technological worker in

concert in resonance with the intention

of nature which is to do the same thing

the human world is simply a catalyst for

Nature's intentions we are speeding up

Nature's program of dimensional

Transcendence

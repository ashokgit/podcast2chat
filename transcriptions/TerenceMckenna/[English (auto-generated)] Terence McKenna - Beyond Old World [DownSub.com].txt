foreign

this is I suppose like a litmus test for

paranoia is this going to be a nightmare

of you know uh 24-hour a day

sadomasochistic pornography or is it

going to be uh will we literally build

heaven on Earth knowing what I know

about the human animal I suspect it'll

be both and because we're not going to

get everybody Marching In The Same

Direction on this and one person's hell

is another person's heaven but

the imagination which to this point has

been a human faculty and uh the

consolation of artists is about to turn

into real estate

you know as real as any real estate

there is

and uh

in a way I think the the shamans who for

the past 50 000 years have been uh

essentially they left over the material

phase of imagination engineering

and went to nanotechnology

25 30 000 Years Ago by nanotechnology I

mean Reliance on machines to achieve

your goals machines that are under one

and now that are in size smaller than a

billionth of an inch uh they we don't

think of drug molecules as machines but

in fact they are machines and they

perform their work in the synapse like

machines so Shamanism didn't use matter

to build its realities it it was more

sophisticated than that it directly

addressed the capacity of the human mind

in the presence of unusual

neurochemicals to produce unusual uh

phenomena and unusual uh sensoria

experience now what's happening is these

two strains of development the let's

call it the pharmacological Nano

technological low-tech natural shamanic

path and the high-tech material

manipulating

macro physical Technologies are

encountering each other and meeting in

the domain of the modern computer

and

this this is fascinating the world is

becoming more and more defined by the

imagination and those of us who are

involved in in creating this

I think have the feeling that it has in

it a kind of built-in Dynamic toward

finality

in other words this is not a process

that can go on for hundreds of thousands

or even hundreds of years because the

human imagination is so endlessly

self-transcending whatever its most

advanced creation of the moment is it's

in the process of obviating and denying

it and seeking to go beyond it and you

know I think it was Plato I'm not sure

he said it first but

said if God does not exist human beings

will create god well I think the truth

is they're not even going to wait to

find out it's easier to cut to the

technical solution and sort the whole

thing out later and if the God we make

and the God we find are in conflict with

each other they'll just have to Duke it

out

but maybe they'll marduke it out I'm not

sure

because you know there's a wonderful

phrase in uh myths dreams and Mysteries

a book by merciliad where he's talking

about powered flight of all things

the Wright brothers and he says whatever

we make of this as an engineering feat

it speaks volumes about the human

psyche's desire to transcend itself

infinitely and so you know in a sense

the powered flight is a psychological

breakthrough because man flies well then

spacecraft we break beyond the Embrace

of gravity and these these technological

breakthroughs are always presented in

terms of overcoming some set of boundary

constraints imposed by nature and in

virtual reality all boundary constraints

are overcome by Nature just as in the

imagination but the imagination

metabolically sustained in other words

that you eat well then you smoke a lot

of hash then you enter into a an

imaginative reality but as metabolism

Ebbs and flows as your food digests as

the drugs leave your system uh this

reality whatever it is Falls to pieces

and it's washed away uh

but the reality the virtual reality is

created in codes are more enduring they

are in fact as enduring as the code

maker and so we're beginning to talk in

terms of Dreams which don't go away

worlds of the imagination which one can

work on for months and then lead one's

critics through and collect their

critiques and make the corrections and

and to dot the eyes and cross the t's

according to the way one's critics and

friends think it should be done

and so what this means is somehow the

imagination

always

among the most private of domains is

like everything else under the impact of

the new technologies being redefined so

that there is no private and public

distinction anymore so we are on the

brink of losing in a sense a part of our

individuality

we are going to be able to build

hallucinations

and then walk through them and discuss

them and edit them and re-edit them and

uh I you know to this point we've been

doing psychology sort of like a blind

man polishing a Cadillac in total

darkness you know if you keep excellent

notes and don't lose your place you form

a kind of a notion of what a Cadillac

must be

but what we're about to do is just turn

on the fluorescent lighting and look at

the thing and I don't know what this

will bring I think it will redefine this

we are a great mystery to ourselves and

to each other but not in principle

only through limitations imposed by the

physical body and limitations of

technology and so I think you know what

our yearning for Community for

collectivity for telepathy for Universal

human understanding is in a sense going

to be self-fulfilled by simply opening

up the imagination not as a private

Dimension but as a public and shared

Dimension and this will be I think

incredibly enriching and surprising we

are going to find out

what the human Critter really is and

what we are really capable of and I I'm

not afraid of this at all because I I

think

well basically I'm a platonist

and Plato identified the good and the

true and the Beautiful

as the same thing

but notice it's very hard to know what

is good

and it's quite difficult even more

difficult to know what is true

but it is intuitively understood what is

beautiful

so beauty is the easy way

Beauty leads to the good and the truth

and we are on the brink I think of

taking a stride toward beauty that is

the greatest stride in that direction

since the emergence of language in the

human species and the emergence of

language in the human species was the

first

shoe dropping in this Enterprise and the

building of virtual realities that can

be shared and critiqued and understood

is the dropping of the second

chew a true civilization lives in its

own imagination and lives through

its imagination

and when when this is

an accessible possibility to most people

I think a great deal of our inhumanity

will simply fall away from us because it

is not inherent it is the product of

misapprehension

misapprehension of each other's goals

and intent and his aesthetic

so

um I think that's about all I have to

say about that

I get spun into it and I can't stop I

don't know whether I'm talking to

yourself or to me to you or to me but uh

this is some of what we'll talk about

this weekend this may be the longest

single uninterrupted feel you hear from

me as I said these things are best

driven when people inject their agenda

into it but these are the things I'm

thinking about history feels very risky

to a lot of people I think there that it

is risky but it is because the stakes

are so high we really have an

opportunity to transcend ourselves and

to fulfill the human Enterprise on this

planet and uh

you know I I'm so aware of

the limitations of the people of the

past

their agonies their concerns I mean how

many children died

were born stillborn how many women died

in childbirth nine times in the last

five million years the glaciers have

ground south from the poles pushing

everything in their path those people

didn't drop the ball

the amount of human suffering and Agony

that has gone into carrying us to this

moment of privilege and opportunity is

incalculable and can only be redeemed if

we bring

this inherent human Beauty uh into the

world as spiritual food for ourselves

and for the human community

well it's very interesting I I'm working

on a book now a lot of it is about the

subject of language

um it's it's a little hard to talk about

it in English because in English the

word language both means the general

linguistic facility and it also is heard

as meaning speech

and as I looked into language and

studied it and studied what other people

had said about it I I there were some

surprises the the first surprise is that

the the straight people in the field the

what is taught in the academy is that

language is no more than 35

000 years old

this is was astonishing to me uh I just

for some reason my own intellectual

biases assumed that the conservative

academic position would be that spoken

language is old because it seems so

basically a part of us how can it have

arrived 35 000 years ago that makes it

something as artificial as the bicycle

pump or a transistor radio

well the problem here is

that this word language is misheard in

English so in writing this new book I

had to make a very clear distinction

language is old

honeybees do it dolphins do it it's even

possible when you think of chemical

communication that flowers and ants do

it nature is knit together by

communication which has rules has syntax

and so is language if you've ever stood

in a in a rainforest or any species

dense environment

it's alive with signals with sounds with

odors that are carrying messages these

things are not just produced for a

static effect they are have intended

hearers and and so forth and so on but

and language in human beings

is old because we know that we evolve

from pack hunting primates socialized

primates that had as we observe the

behavior of primates alive in the world

today very complex repertoires of

signals signals which mean dive for

cover an eagle is cruising the area or

here is food enough for a dozen of us

and so forth complex pack

signaling uh

what happened and I

it was the greatest

technological leap we've ever made

and in some ways the cleanest and the

most astonishing it's almost like a

resonance remember last night I

mentioned how strange it was that the

largest buildings people ever built were

the first buildings they ever built well

the greatest technological Revolution

so far ever launched by human beings was

in a sense this early one I won't call

it the first because there was two of

making before that there was fire before

that but somewhere in Africa no less

than 40

000 years ago

and this this means a time when human

beings who look like you and I maybe a

little pigmentation differential but

basically people exactly like you and I

had already radiated all over the planet

I mean by forty thousand years ago

nobody argues that people weren't

everywhere recent finds in Australia

have pushed back the date of Aboriginal

penetration into Australia to a hundred

and twenty thousand years and that's not

that's Wollongong University Department

of archeology stuff a hundred and twenty

thousand years so people were all over

the world well did they communicate

they certainly did communicate they

communicated with dance with gesture and

leading back to your question with music

they communicated uh in all kinds of

ways

but we now know from the study of the

introduction of media that if if a

medium of sufficient power and bandwidth

is introduced into a population it will

abandon

all previous forms of media in favor of

this we saw this in America after World

War II when a print literate Society

within a decade became a television

Society we are seeing it now we're in

the space of five years the internet

goes from being say what to

indispensable for huge numbers of people

and that's in the space of five years

someone in Africa

probably loaded

experiment experimenting with singing

and chanting and sound had the was

lifted out of their plane in other words

they actually had to break through in

the imagination

and they said how would it be if

this amazing word the power of if

how would it be if we decided that a

certain sound

is associated with a certain thing

and let's play a little game every time

I make this sound you think of this

thing and let's make a little list let's

take five sounds and assign them to five

common things and now I'll make the

sound and you think the thing

well behind all this is the the

organizational architecture of the human

organism which onto a game such as that

will effortlessly lay what is called

syntax

uh and Chomsky and others have shown

that this that what is called the rules

of transformational grammar or the Deep

structures of language are genetic

uh all languages

in order to be intelligible have to obey

these rules the language which does not

obey these rules is not a language is

not intelligible uh

so through a breakthrough in imagination

a kind of stuff

just entertaining each other with Funny

Mouth noises uh language was produced

probably I mean literally at a definable

moment in space and time a person you

know the the mother or the father of all

medium

discovered utterance and if it was like

an intellectual virus

spreading through the population and

moving as quickly as human beings could

carry it because it was say Superior

form of media before communication had

been I imagine highly slanted toward

emotional

States and time-bounded States you know

you go up to somebody you take hold of

them you look at them and they

understand we're either going hunting or

we're going to have sex and it will be

spelled out in just the next little

while that kind of thing and this kind

of communication was the

a sufficiently viscous social glue to

hold small hunting Gathering groups

together as society complexifies and

spreads out through space and time it

either loses its coherency or it evolves

methods of communication to keep it in

touch with itself I am not a linguist I

read a lot of this linguistic literature

without really understanding it but I

know that the people who give their life

to this believe that they can

extrapolate the rules of spoken

language of the Indo-European of modern

European languages to reason backward

toward a language that was spoken 12 to

10 000 years ago

European or

proto-indo-european and this was thought

to be the whole you know the great

achievement of linguistics as of 15 or

20 years ago now a new generation of

people have pushed it further back

there is a language called North static

that was spoken on the Anatolian plateau

in across southern Europe 15 to 25

000 years ago and now people like

shavroshkin at Stanford and this is was

all done by Russians by the way the

Russians hold The High Ground in

linguistics it was the Russians it was

Russian insights that cracked the Mayan

language too but shavroshkin and his

people are now talking about a language

called Old World

and old world

is the first language ever spoken on

this planet by higher primates beyond

the old world there is an articulate

silence an old world is a 35

000 year old language uh how can we know

such things you have to push into the

linguistic literature and you're a

better man than I am gangadin but there

are websites you can go to where people

speak in Old World

and you can hear what it sounded like

and um

sounds like a bunch of really primitive

people

how do we know that we've really evolved

well a funny this is an interesting area

you know one of my sub themes is novelty

and that supposedly reality becomes more

novel as we approach the present and

this is certainly true of biology and

many many phenomena but there is an

important exception

so I'm told I'm not yet entirely

convinced of this but convinced enough

to pass it on and that is though this

obviously contains the paradox language

has seem to be more complicated as you

go back in time

uh

structurally and in number of words

so that for instance

um Old English

is considerably richer in certain areas

than a Modern English now I say probably

what's happening is the technical

vocabularies are keeping the boat

roughly

at equilibrium but you know for for

every

widget word a word describing some

subset of our technology if we're losing

words that indicate emotional

nuances or nuances of Rapport and under

understanding than the language is being

impoverished most Scholars of English

believe that you know Shakespeare caught

the wave Shakespeare is not only a

phenomenon of immense human genius

focused in one person but it's also a

moment of incredible linguistic richness

and opportunity that didn't exist 200

years before and didn't survive 200.

years after

well but as I lay in the tubs at esselen

the vast vocabulary of subtle gradients

of interpersonal States amongst the

longing need rejection Triumph and

defeat are past in front of me and

frankly I

I'd rather read my manual on my hard

disk sometimes

but I'm a tough nut to cry

um

but this does lead on to to an aspect of

all this that I wanted to talk about

which is language is I mean I'm sure

you've heard it said it's a double-edged

sword because it liberates as it

enslaves all Clarity is achieved

by the sacrifice of

um

true identity

you know the world is actually a messy

and difficult to articulate place and if

you can make it all seem very simple and

smooth running then you're a con artist

of some sort

yeah I mean

yes well one group of linguists suggests

probably the big impulse producing

language originally was the wish to lie

foreign

and I always you know along this line

the wonderful thing which Winston

Churchill said at the height of World

War II he said truth is so precious that

she must always be accompanied by a

bodyguard of Lies

that's an interesting point of view the

truth is not something you Trot out and

show everybody that you you surround

truth with lies so that only the

discerning

you know we we simple straightforward

plain dealers don't think like that but

believe me you get with the an Amazonian

Shaman or someone like that he is not

operating under a strong moral

obligation to tell you the truth the

whole truth and nothing but the truth as

quickly as he possibly can no it's all

about you know leading you this way and

then dropping you and watching you

wiggle and then leading you another way

and eventually because truth is guarded

this is in our society the

commodification of information has made

it something that you want to deliver

with maximum punch to its target

audience as fast as possible and cash

the check and get out but that that is

not um traditionally how it's done

foreign

well it divides the seamlessness of

reality into the articulated and the

unarticulated you know Trumbull Stickney

who's not exactly a household name

uh was one of those poets who died in

the trenches of World War One the golden

generation and he wrote a poem called

meaning Zedge

and he said in that poem I do not

understand you is because

I lean over your meanings Edge and feel

the dizziness of the things that you

have not said

and it's that the dizziness of things

unsaid that always surrounds uh uh

the Enterprise of communication

especially spoken language now to go

back to this thing about the evolution

of language and technology and are we

getting better or worse at it

communication

I discern at least if you look at the

evolution of media the way we would look

at the evolution of a species or a group

of Genera in an organic situation

a a very pronounced preference for the

visual

we

you know from the simply the idea of

colorful and Rich speech which was all

we had for a long time gives way in the

early 19th century to photography and

it's still and it's black and white but

immediately the people who invent it can

think of nothing but color and motion

and by 1900 they've got that under

control and then there's stuff like

stereophonic sound and on and on clearly

we view the language forming Enterprise

as a task not yet brought to completion

one of the things that seems to always

come up in these things is the fact that

so-called primitive or Aboriginal or

pre-literate people using psychedelic

plants that

melt local cultural conditioning seem to

access

place where language is much more a

visual Enterprise

ayahuasca

circles

sing

but the singing is critiqued as though

it were pictorial activity in other

words the after the shamans stop singing

you hear people saying I like the part

with the orange spots but I thought the

olive drab magenta section was

self-indulgent there is something like

that

and you're thinking you know this is a

critique of a song it no the song is the

sound is the carrier the acoustical wave

is no longer in the foreground of the

experience of appreciating the

performance it has become the carrier of

something visible and

you know a lot of people think that

somewhere in the human future lies

telepathy and it's usually imagined as

you hear what I think

a kind of extension of what we have but

I think it's more likely to develop

along the lines of you see what I mean

uh in other words we add dimensionality

to language and we then can walk around

in it I touched on some of this uh last

night

with the virtual reality so because

virtual reality in the service of the

ideals that I'm interested in would

become a technology for showing each

other the contents of our imagination

with less ambiguity than we have ever

had before yeah

well I suppose every technology has

created more opportunity for deception

uh you can't have complex

illusionistic realities unless you work

in pictorial space

yes I don't think these technologies

will reform

uh the human

character also I'm not sure

subterfuge is a major part of art it

certainly is a major part of of leisure

domain

every sentence is essentially a

conjuration

and you know the rabbit of meaning is

pulled out of the the haft of

constructive syntax so uh you you cannot

have

uh truth

unless you allow for the possibility of

error you know this is the point that

illuminates why predestination is a

waste of time

predestination is the idea that the

universe is a kind of film and it's

running and it's all determined how it's

going to come out and there's nothing

anybody or anything can do to affect it

God created it and it's unfolding well

the uh

the thing that makes predestination

Theory worthless in my estimation is

notice that if that's true then you

think what you think because you can't

think anything else

and that puts the Enterprise of seeking

truth in a Preposterous position in

order to seek truth one must have the

option of screwing up

and then it's the dichotomy between the

screwing up and the finding truth that

creates the sense of dynamic uh

existential completion

well this is now you're at The Cutting

Edge I mean yes yes and yes

found is the fourth dimension

sound is a very effective way for

transducing energy into the body the

body is virtually transparent to sound

uh the mushroom said to me once

apropos of absolutely nothing it said

what you call a man we call time

and time and metabolism

metabolism is

permitted by time and somehow time is

caused by metabolism and then sound is

in there as an energy

transducer and yes I think

a future technology of of sound probably

will cure disease and set people right

all this business that goes on in

Shamanism with blowing on the body and

projecting sound into the body obviously

some of it is misunderstood and marginal

and Showmanship but at the core uh

I found this I think

not yet been given its complete role in

all of this the fact that you can see

sound

uh under certain conditions you know

there are there's a phenomenon called

sonoluminescence

where that creates temperatures 20 times

greater than the surface of the Sun this

is done in a test tube by simply using

acoustical waves and bubbling fluid to

collapse and create extremely brief high

pressure States

um

so

no luminescence there's a website you

can visit isn't there always

yeah yeah

well I guess what I'm sort of saying is

that once you have the concept of of

nanotechnology then you see that drugs

and

prosthesis or computers or tools are are

categorically migrating toward each

other you've probably heard me say uh

you know the only difference between

computers and drugs is that one is too

large to swallow

and and our best people are working on

that very problem uh so uh Bitcoin

yeah I I think that

from the middle of the 19th century on

without really much drugs to help them

along I mean a little ether a little

hashish

uh poets and artists in Europe were

obsessed with synesthesia

there's a wonderful New Yorker cartoon

maybe some of you saw it

thought a bunch of guys in suits or

sitting around what is obviously a

corporate boardroom and in the

background there's the profit and loss

chart and it's clearly headed into hell

and the chairman of the board is saying

to a small smiling man sitting at the

other end of the table you're right

Higgins a deliberate disordering of the

senses worked for rabo but would it work

for us

so this is a reference to a symbolist

poet of of the 19th century and and the

belief that we need to erase the

boundaries between the senses and create

a synesthesia a hallucinogenic a

psychedelic if you will reality I mean

the late 19th century the

pre-raphaelites the Jurgen Steele

impulse that was all like you know they

could smell psychedelics in the air of

the future they couldn't quite get high

but they were definitely bird dogging in

the right direction

so uh yeah that the trick if we're going

to design our own

states of mind is to make sure that we

don't dump the baby out with the bath

water we want the net to be as haunted

as possible we don't want to lose it's

out of this stick connections back into

the darker resources recesses and

resources of of the unconscious that's

why Bill Gibson's novel Neuromancer is

so prescient because here it is this

super technological fantasy but at the

center of the net the gods of voodoo

are reappearing and I I came to the

realization thinking about the internet

um you know the other is within us

uh when the other finally if it ever

comes into full manifestation it won't

come in mile wide ships of titanium that

position themselves over the Secretariat

building of the U.N it won't come like

that it will come out of human

hands and human dreams it will be fully

other I'm not copping out here it will

be fully other but it can only be built

through us this address is what I was

beginning to get at last night when I

talked about non-local information

the alien is

real

but the alien is not here in the stupid

sense

the alien can only manifest itself

through us

but this probably means that given a

sufficiently resilient technology it can

manifest completely

through us

so uh in a sense the internet is a kind

of landing pad

there has always been in our fantasies

of extraterrestrial contact the notion

of the pad which has to be built for

them and people claim it's the Nazca

Lines and all you know it's an archetype

the idea of the prepared space that

awaits the arrival of the other

but now because of the nature of the

internet because you can't see who's

coding

you can almost imagine that we're

calling the thing forth and I think it

will probably appear as a website

and you know when it's when it's sorted

out you'll realize my God

HTTP

colon double slash zetar

reticuli.org is really coming from Zeta

reticulate but through through virtual

uh through uh non-local balmian space

yeah

it's totally separate in the sense that

it is somewhere else in the universe and

evolving completely along its own lines

and not in any way under our control but

then you turn The Coin over and the

division between it and us is completely

seamless because of

the non-local nature of information in

other words this is an incredibly

empowering idea if true I mean it will

make a revolution in Psychology that few

people have yet even sensed coming what

we're talking about here is putting the

jungian ideas the collective unconscious

first expanding it to the size of the

cosmos and then showing with physics

exactly how the trick is done

so we are not separate from anywhere

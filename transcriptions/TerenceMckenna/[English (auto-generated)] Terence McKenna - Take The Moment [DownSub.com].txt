foreign

what we're saying is you know we all

before the internet

you were who you are you knew what you

knew and you knew there was a great deal

that you didn't know you had once known

it but forgotten it or never learned it

but somebody somewhere knew it and

because we had this vast dark companion

the unconscious

bad things keep jumping out of it

it was remarkable to me that throughout

the Cold War period

were a planet ruled by carnivorous

monkeys

filled with ideological hatreds under

immense economic and social pressure and

yet nobody ever used Atomic weapons

except once the the two Japanese

instances and in a sense they don't

count

because they didn't know what it was

they had to use it to see what it was

and once they saw what it was

remarkable restraint

set in uh I would never have guessed

that we would have been capable I mean

remember how deep the fear of the Soviet

Union was remember that for 35 years a

thermonuclear strike was a possibility

within a half an hour of any

undo movement on the other side and yet

somehow we got through that so there is

in the human animal an effort to awaken

you know it was um

it was HP uh no no it was H.G Wells who

said history is a race between education

and catastrophe

and you know it is uh it it it's it it's

a White Knuckle Enterprise you know

catastrophe edges inches ahead education

moves ahead uh and again if it were a

Level Playing Field I'd be betting on

catastrophe because I believe that

nature favors the good the true and the

Beautiful I've got all my money on

education I think we'll make it but I

think we have to scare ourselves to

death in order to keep focused you know

we're we're primates and we don't really

dig in and get rolling until we're

painted into a corner yeah man

I guess the answer is to you have to

somehow make it your friend

you have to make it your friend

uh

there are there are ways to do that

actually I made a little list you played

right into my hands uh

uh

the the first and probably oldest friend

older even than than

psychedelics is dreams

uh dreams are hugely important

uh I was in Australia in February and I

did a lot of reading up before I went

down uh

the aboriginals of Australia are have

been at the cultural Enterprise for a

long long time

along a different path than the rest of

us I mean I've spent time with Amazon

tribes and with people in Central Asia

and yes they're funky and yes they're

different but these Australian

aboriginals are on to something quite

other

uh many people barely open their eyes

people sit silently people don't talk

this again relates to what we said about

language in Australia among these people

you get the feeling that they don't talk

because they're not sure it's here to

stay

if if an Aboriginal wants to communicate

something to you they would far rather

walk with you a half mile into the bush

and point at it than to Simply describe

it back at camp

so uh the dream time

and the young and unconscious

and the conscious the unconscious made

conscious by the internet begin to sound

like the same things I previously didn't

have much interest in the Australian

aboriginals because I was slightly

irritated by Reliant on psychedelics

and so it was like it was like what am I

supposed to do with these people

they're clearly very loaded and very far

out and how do they do that without

drugs it was Paradigm

agonizing to me well it turns out that

they just are better at keeping secrets

than the people in the Amazon there's a

revolution

breaking over ethnobotany we have been

saying for decades that South America

was the most hallucinogen Rich ecology

on the planet and why was that and

wasn't it fascinating and so forth and

so on in the next 18 months uh some

Australian

ethnobotanists and and Trippers are

going to publish data that shows that

the Australian Aboriginal worldview is

entirely running on DMT

these vacations this Gumtree ecology the

stretches from Queensland down to the

south coast is replete with DMT it's

simply that the Aboriginal culture is

even more secretive than other cultures

other Aboriginal cultures in other parts

of the world and only very very slowly

is this information

uh being let out so dreams are one of

the great friends

of the imagination

yeah that's what I'm saying basically

and there'll be more it's not for me to

take the Thunder very good people have

hundreds and hundreds of pages about to

be published and they've got the data

and they've done the analysis

um yeah

well I pretty much take the position

that there may be people who can do it

on the match

but there's no technique it's something

you have to be born to and there's no

culture that can do it I think

throughout

the human population there may be one

person in a hundred who has a futuristic

set of synapses because I I occasionally

in a group like this somebody will come

up to me and say well I've never taken a

psychedelic drug but I know exactly what

you're talking about and I see visions

and so forth and so on I used to just

think that these people were nut cases

I've now encountered enough of it that I

modify my position to say these are just

incredibly fortunate

people and you can't tell how much of it

is personality and how much of it is

chemically real

again how

how much of what I'm saying to you right

now it's being processed differently in

every head in the room some people are

seeing pictures some people are hearing

words some people are logically building

on what I say and for some people it's

just music and so it's it's very

different and again it's something very

hard to share because it's so

subjective but throughout the world

there are what we would call primitive

or Aboriginal cultures and some are

drugs

users and some are not and it isn't a

matter of ecology it's a matter of

something else in eastern Ecuador you

have tribes that are just totally druggy

and the cross the river people who never

touch anything

living basically what appear to The

unschooled Observer it's two cultural

systems not that different

from each other so you know it's uh

but generally speaking uh

the Psychedelic cultures seem more

let me put it this way the Psychedelic

cultures seemed less dogmatic

Shamanism comes in two flavors at least

two

there's what I call a a traditional

Shamanism is very rigid and ritual

driven and usually non-psychedelic

and the other kind of shamanism uh there

are rituals but they are basically for

the consumer not the producer and what

shamans in these psychedelic cultures

are are simply alienated intellectuals

you know I've been in situations in the

Amazon where you fly into some remote

place and and the people who come and

the women come and they want to touch

the airplane

and they want to look at your camera and

touch your clothes and all this and so

while this is going on meanwhile

standing off

is the shaman and he doesn't give a

about the airplane or your camera or any

of that he

is interested in you as a person and

what he is is he's alienated from the

values of his Culture The Keeper of the

values

is the one person who knows that the

values are

that's what they're doing in that

function it's like somebody has to know

and so all the people are you know cow

Towing and going through their business

but the shaman at the top realizes my

God we stare out onto an abyss we do not

know and they're like scientists I mean

they are scientists

yeah

well this is an interesting question

there's a hard and soft answer it

depends on whether you think the need to

commodify is is so basic to human beings

that it can't be removed if that's true

than the internet still holds out a

certain amount of Hope

a hardcore anti-capitalist

position wants to eliminate capitalism

because it sees it as an unreclaimable

evil

but it's possible that the only thing

wrong with capitalism is that it's set

it manufactures distributes and

commodifies physical objects

what if there was a capitalism that only

commodified information and Light

uh that might be more tolerable uh

I you know in the future not that long

in the future if you want to live that

Versailles it'll cost you a 149 dollars

to buy the software package and set it

up and live in it well if Versailles can

be made to cost 149 dollars how much is

it worth and the answer is only what the

market will pay

so uh I think

for a long time this process of of

raising standards of living has been

underway and it is certainly true that

today in the world

hundreds of millions of people uh live

better than

uh Emperors and Kings two centuries ago

so I think the the important thing well

before we totally dismiss capitalism we

should see if it can operate in a

virtual informational environment less

destructively uh if it can't then

something else will have to come along

but certainly capitalism based on the

extraction of resources and their

fabrication by cheap labor populations

into objects to be sold in a central

economy that's the that's finished

that's a dinosaur that's self-limiting

oh because there is no not and

ultimately exploitable resource base the

end of that kind of capitalism is is

easily discerned

well that's an interesting question is

there a kind of natural selection of

means in the marketplace

there probably is for example imagine

governments deal with information

completely differently than corporations

if a government obtains a proprietary

technology its impulse is to classify it

move it out of sight and exploit it for

political advantage

if a corporation achieves a proprietary

technology

it drops a huge amount of money on

promoting it Russia's products based on

it to Market and tries to spread it

everywhere as fast as it can

this certainly has caused an evolution

of certain kinds of Technology but the

two systems the the capitalist corporate

system and the governmental system value

and put emphasis on different kinds of

Technologies for example nation states

use War as an instrument of national

policy

corporations almost never do that

corporations don't like War it busts up

environments it makes products difficult

to move around and where you had happy

healthy customers you now have

hollow-eyed refugees standing around

with their hands out

but those were national interests no

Corporation could have launched a war

like that it was it wasn't Exxon who

hadn't knife poised at their throat it

was the economies of France Germany and

the United States

also that war was

Generations ago a completely different

set of political rules were in place

that was probably the last

of those sorts of Wars I would bet what

capitalism does with war is if it

exports it to already burnt out Market

areas like Rwanda Bosnia Albania they

don't care what people do to each other

in those places because they don't have

there's no Market there anyway uh

let me go on with my list here I think I

got through dreams and drugs which were

probably the biggies this is Friends of

the imagination in case you lost your

place here uh

uh

fiction

and the Enterprise

of fiction not necessarily science

fiction although it's interesting if you

look at the Golden Age of Science

Fiction the magazines that created that

had names like amazing

astounding and if

these are the very words and themes that

we've been pursuing around here but

fiction is until we get virtual reality

up and running in the hands of a master

the best way we have of showing each

other the contents of our own heads any

of you who have made your way through

the remembrance of things past proofs

enormous novel about industry act life

in Paris there are thoughts uttered

there

that are so fragile and delicate that

when you read it

you think you were the only person who

ever thought this and you never bothered

to mention it to anybody because it

seems so ineffable and yet

proofs has gotten it down on the page so

it it shows you what human beings are

and of course our world pardon

I'm trying to think of an example

there's an example where they're going

to a beach town and he's riding with

this Dowager woman

a great society woman and he's watching

the trees so by the carriage and he

notices that now how does this work that

the nearer trees move faster than the

trees further away and then over this

spatial metaphor is mapped a temporal

metaphor about people changing in time

and you know God knows what it is in

French but even in English it's this

exquisitely

complicated thought that you wouldn't

think anybody could actually do justice

to the feeling and then and yet there it

is in its completion

uh the other great friend of the

imagination is travel

travel is the way to is another way a

more gentle way to break down cultural

conditioning I mean what we call culture

shock is when you go to Afghanistan or

Albania and you realize that your

expectations of how a table should be

theft what a toilet looks like how a bus

ticket works and how a telephone is

supposed to operate we're just so

narrowly defined but now you're

confronted with a telephone and a toilet

and you don't even know which end is

which uh

and it's not for nothing that the

vocabulary of psychedelic experience has

borrowed from the vocabulary of travel

so we take a trip we have a journey we

go to an alien landscape uh

and then finally uh the the Great

friend of the imagination is the future

because it's in the future that we place

our hopes our fears our suppositions I

mean the future is a land of

things imagined things that have not yet

undergone the formality of actually

occurring

as a friend of the imagination well I

did I not mention last night that the

two great motivators were food fantasies

and sex fantasies and yes uh

the sexual imagination is at a very

early I almost said primitive but I

don't mean that but I mean early level

because if I'm understanding you

correctly it revolves around the if

operator uh if I approach the desirable

female with the proper blandishment if

and then of course just sexual fantasy

then we will do this then we will do

that and so forth and so on

it certainly is a vehicle for Altered

States whether I would call them

imagination or not

suppose I would but now that I'm

thinking about your question I think you

know there are pitfalls in the

imagination

and probably the sexual Pitfall is

sentimentality

uh tastelessness is in there too

sentimentality is a virulent form of

tastelessness

and

sentimentality is is very hard to root

out you may think you're a hard cookie

but I'll bet there are areas of

sentimental delusion so Broad and deep

in every one of us and some people carry

that to the Grave they're the lucky ones

the rest of us have divorces

bankruptcies muggings and what have you

and slowly our sentimentality is bound

to Dallas

and uh you know it's a good thing to

lose sentimentality because it's a false

pathetic and I think we recognize it

it's also a very easily manipulate it is

truly a false aesthetic in the hands of

modern media because it is a great Ploy

for buying if you can induce

sentimentality in people they will buy

the object of that induction

um

yeah

well you're worried of idea your word

idealism is good here because it brings

me to something I always eventually get

to which is in line with this thought

culture is not your friend

ideology

is not your friend and ideology

some people think what we're trying to

do here is sort out good ideologies from

bad should I be a Marxist should I be

deconstructionist and the answer is no

none of the above all the theologies

are

viral infections of some sort mimetic

infections that erode your

functionability and your

comfort with yourself ideology set up

polarities that are based on discontent

and ideologies are always always

based on false premises whatever the I

mean name and ideology and I'll tell you

the false premises that it's based on so

uh

part of this process of cultural

maturities that I've been talking about

is to get Beyond ideology without

embracing cynicism it's not a you

thing it's a

deeply saddening awareness that we are

not yet Angel enough

that we should take ourselves that

seriously yeah

yes I would say sentimentality is the

feeling of attachment we have to our

ideology so for instance someone says

well you know Marxism maybe we didn't

have the right answer but we certainly

have a sense of the mission and a

wonderful

you know we knew who we were and that's

crazy talk you know if it was wrong it

was wrong I mean it's like old Nazis

sitting around to sing the great old

days you know what was so great about

the old days you want Community join a

bowling league for crying out loud yeah

now that that's a sub that's a that's a

lesser evil that's Nostalgia another

impulse for marketing Frenzy

but but Romanticism I think is a

legitimate impulse and well situated in

historical context and so forth and so

on sentimentality can break out anywhere

anytime and and is you know can find

anything for for its object

sentimentality is a lazy form of

thinking I think you know people

people don't want to think the hard

thought

s and yet I find the hard thoughts very

paradoxically liberating

for instance here is the hard thought

uh I don't want anybody to burst into

tears on me so gird your loins but uh

you know I've spent a lifetime taking

drugs knocking around the world having

Affairs being married being unmarried

this that and the other if somebody

asked me so what do you know what have

you learned uh I would have to say what

I've learned is that nothing lasts

there's a hard thought

is is that a cause for Joy or despair

well if you're thinking about everything

you loved and how it's going to turn

into mush as your shovels into the grave

it's a hard thought but on the other

hand if you think of all the jerks

who've oppressed you it's a great

consolation no

that they too will go down into that

good night

nothing lasts if that is not a cause for

Joy or despair it's a cause for

expanding one's feeling in the moment

if nothing lasts then there's a

conclusion not a feeling to be drawn

from Bad observation the conclusion to

be drawn from it is then

the felt presence of the immediate

moment must be what life is for

and somebody who could take that

perception and use it that way could

immediately transcend all kinds of

neurotic Behavior longing regrets doubts

fears no you're just saying no the felt

presence is immediate experience

yeah sentimentalism yeah

well first of all let me comment on the

Buddhist thing I'm I'm not that friendly

to that formulation because it still is

postponing gratification it's saying

death is the bouquet of life you should

live toward death I would say the

bouquet of Life Is This Moment but to

the more important point of longevity

I certainly am not interested in living

forever whatever that might mean because

I suspect if you live forever you miss

the point

in other words I think you'll miss the

bouquet on the other hand I don't see

anything wrong with well no that's too

much to say

problem I have with living

whatever three score and ten is you do

get into political issues of is are are

people buying

time at the expense of somebody else

one of the weirdest things this culture

about this culture is we've invented the

sin for which there is no name so beyond

most people's ability to conceive

and this sin that we've invented is we

steal the future from our children

you know we do it with our medical

health care plans where we know that all

this fine surgery and stuff that you're

getting is at the expense of the next

generation of people we overuse

resources leaving nothing for future

Generations I don't know how that would

all be sorted out I'm I am attracted by

the idea of uh living as long as I want

to live

uh I wonder how long that that would be

and of course if you make people

comfortable

probably they would like to live a lot

longer what reason is there for a

person to check out of a comfortable

situation in a sense what nature does is

make the body a less and less

comfortable place to be until finally

you just say

all right already you know

take them beam me up Scotty uh the but

then you know the other possibility is

what if there were forms of existence

that were dematerialized how would we

feel about going into circuitry for a

few rounds of Eternity and what are the

moral implications of that uh I don't

know I've had this argument with Robert

Anton Wilson he's a big Enthusiast for

Life Extension

um

it depends on what you think death is

and I've managed to talk myself into the

idea that death is probably

not simply dissolution and Chaos not

because I have received any guidance

from on high but just as I observe

nature

she has a wonderful

parsimoniousness about her behavior and

clearly this form

which is basically an unraveled DNA

molecule that is now making a lot of

claims on resources in the environment

in order to keep this body going uh

is

nature put a lot of effort into this and

I think that the best model for what

life is based not on religious thinking

but on biological thinking is life is

what you get when a hyperdimensional

object

protrudes into ordinary space

in other words if we take this cup

and uh and cut it into

it doesn't change it just becomes a cup

in two pieces but it doesn't bleed it

doesn't rot it doesn't lose its Essence

if we take any living being from a

bacterium to a brontosaur and cut it

into the entire system falls apart very

quickly and we've created a mess and we

see that the thing that we had is no

longer there so I think what biology is

is the intrusion into three-dimensional

space and time of hyperdimensional

objects and the other clue to that that

seems an argument for it is that we do

have this thing called a mind

but we can't find it anywhere it doesn't

seem to be anywhere even when you get

down to the level of electrodes in the

brain and saying words to people and

watching oscilloscopes you still can't

seem to quite nail it down so I think

probably these these objects retract

back into uh

hyperspace higher space and that this is

what the soul is the soul is the mar

there there is something to this idea of

a morphogenetic field and uh and we

clothed ourselves in matter but we are

we are not math here and so to actually

complete a human

cycle of existence uh you you have to go

into death it's where you came from in

some sense I mean the whole we put a lot

of attention into death we don't look

very much at Birth we think we

understand it I mean we all know the

story about the sperm and the Egg and

and all that but before that

what is going on you know whence cometh

these forms we seem to have the matter

down pretty good but really what what a

being is is the intrusion into

space-time of a form and the form is

unique and then it Retreats I think it

would be one of the Great

joke of human history if here at the end

of the 20th century at the end of the

millennium

with all this techno

hypolas surging around this if we were

to actually gain insight into the after

death

and one of the reasons I'm so Keen for

DMT is because when I have given it to

people who were purported experts in the

after death State Tibetan llamas and

shamans and certain they come back and

they say yep that's the territory all

right

and and so

in my highest States I have had the

Insight which I will convey to you

without saying it's true that this is

the most limited form of existence you

will ever know

you can't be deader than this

this is the bottom line

and and so the good news is it's it's

only up from here

but of course you have to Bath the farm

on this cheerful wrap and there's no

whining if you're wrong this is this

isn't All or Nothing bit and so

naturally it brings your heart into your

throat but

kind of Enterprise life is

all risk and the race to the Swift I

think one last

well I don't know and I wonder what I

will think as I approach The Great

Divide it's easy and the pink of Health

to speculate and play the philosoph and

all that nonsense but you know they're

the Last Dance you dance you dance alone

and nobody will be watching but I have

seen people die and it is an inspiration

I hope to have that Equanimity of mine

the other thing about death that needs

to be said is we all imagine I think

that we will have a leisurely

philosophical death

that's what we all want you know months

to get used to the idea to say goodbye

to gather friends to make our

bequeathans to speak our final wisdom

and you know but death for most people

comes messily and unexpectedly and so I

don't think you should live in an

anticipation of the drama of your

deathbed scene

better to repair to the moment you know

being a realist primarily what I find

always waiting when I return from these

flights of philosophical fantasy is and

Imagination is my body

my history my space my time and these

things are all good

it's a great space a great time a great

body a great being to be so the the real

message of the Psychedelic experience

and of the anti-historical thrust of the

critique we've been

carrying out here is to take the moment

the felt presence of the immediate

experience this is all you know it's all

you will ever know everything else comes

this unconfirmed rumor innuendo

unrealized possibility fading memory

conjecture lie hope who knows but in the

moment of being we have the completion

of being it is always complete every

moment and to the degree that we force

ourselves to look Beyond it or cannot

find ourselves within it we betray it

and then we have more work to do

lesson

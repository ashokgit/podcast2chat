foreign

is not truly lost in that situation

where you wake up and it melts away and

the proof of this and I'm sure you all

have had this experience is

then you go off about your daily

business and then there will be and it

was almost always by coincidence

an image a chance phrase a view of a

street or something and it will cause

you to remember the dream and once you

get a hook into a portion of the dream

if you then work on it you can probably

bring a lot of it out how this works in

psychedelics is if I have an Insight or

something that I particularly want to

remember uh

first of all I will say it

allowed this is strong in printing and

then the real imprinting is to repeat it

a few minutes later and then a few

minutes later again and if you can carry

it over a number of minutes to several

different levels it won't leave you a

very useful shortcut for this is a tape

recorder where if you play the tape of

the trip back after the trip you will

certain just a phrase spoken will set

off a chain of associative recall and

you will retain it this way but to my

mind this is one of what shamanic

training must really be is mnemonic

training the if you want to bring the

stuff back you have to train yourself to

bring it back now this state-bounded

thing it's important to notice we talk

about how dreams are state-bounded how

psychedelics experiences are State

bounded but what we fail to notice

usually is that ordinary reality is

state-bounded I mean if I were to uh ask

any one of you what did you discuss with

the person you had lunch with yesterday

it's probably very touch and go to

actually put this together I had lunch

yesterday with Richard we discussed his

television transmission system but that

was new to me and therefore

easy to retain and also Richard and I

haven't had thousands of hours of

conversation together but uh the person

we are most familiar with is ourselves

well it I don't know if it works for you

like this but I am let us say cleaning

my house vacuuming doing dishes making

beds and I'm thinking all the time

thinking

and I understand why Rome fell I

realized what I said wrong to somebody

two weeks ago I recall a telephone

obligation that I have to fulfill I

think about things that happen years and

years ago and then the doorbell rings

and I go to the door and there's someone

there and they say what are you doing

and I say nothing

this is because the ordinary State of

Consciousness is highly state-bounded we

don't one thing these Buddhists have

certainly gotten right is that attention

to attention is the key to taking

control of your mental life and for most

of it it's just like a river flowing by

you know and every once in a while we

check to see if the river is still

flowing by but we don't attempt to

retain it so uh

memory training is great psychedelic

training and of course as I'm sure you

know there were Arts of memory in the

past we are very poor memorizers because

we rely on Technologies to do it for us

but uh people in the past had all kinds

of Technologies for allowing them to

remember things for instance the most

common one in use in late Antiquity

enough through the Renaissance was the

Memory Palace

approach this is where you think of a

place a big place preferably a place you

know well a school a hospital a

cathedral a university but big and sit

and think about it think about how it

looks as you go through the main doors

and then what you see when you turn to

the left and what you see when you turn

to the right learn this building until

you really can command it with

reasonable vividness in most situations

then if you want to remember something

imagine yourself walking through the

front door of this building turning to

your left and there near the water

fountain you will place an emblem of

this thing you want to remember

and then you will go down the hall and

around the corner and by the fire

extinguishers you will place another

emblem of the next thing you want to

remember well then the act of

remembering this long list of things is

the act of mentally moving through this

imaginary building that you know and

when you come to the water fountain the

clue will be there when you pass the

fire extinguishers in your mind the

emblem you place there will be there now

I know this sounds highly unworkable and

unwieldy but it actually is extremely

workable and and people like catalysts

and chicharo the great late Roman

orators were able to speak for hours on

end uh with lists of Virtues and vices

and interconnecting causes and this sort

of thing because they were masters of

this mnemonic Memory Palace technique

well uh psychedelics are a vivid this is

another one of these things like mantras

yantras and so forth that works on

psychedelics you can do this and so when

you're on a psychedelic and you have an

experience that you want to remember

place it in your memory Palace and the

next time you come past that point in

your memory Palace this uh this thing

will be there now the other trick is

any of you who are interested in this

the last word is the art of memory by

Francis Yates which is a wonderful woman

great scholar of Renaissance magic and

the the final trick is to make the mem

the image extremely Vivid so that for

instance if you're if you're about to

give a speech to your collegium on the

seven deadly sins

well then one of these sins is lust

chose the easy one because I can't

remember what the other six are shows

you where my problem lies so you don't

you don't just place the word lust in

the memory keeping spot you you place

some vivid and shocking image Yates

suggests the image of a nun lifting her

skirts I think this was a classically

suggested one that people were taught to

use well then when you come around the

corner and meet the nun lifting her

skirt you think aha lust that's the

first and then you go on and so forth

and books some of the most astonishing

products of the medieval engravers art

are these books of what are called

emblemasa emblemata are uh surreal

juxtapositions of things and animal

parts and bodies and machines that are

memory emblems made as grotesque surreal

and bizarre as possible in order to make

some Unforgettable that that was the

technique and the surrealists used this

very consciously there is something

about the unexpected the grotesque and

the surprising that is by almost by

definition memorable and this will work

very well in the Psychedelic State as

well if you ask you know just like that

thing

when I did a

um the mushroom experience and there

were certain issues certain things I

went to that ceremony with on my agenda

to be healed from and one of them was to

be relieved from some of my early

Catholic

conditionings that I felt were hanging

me up

and when I was in The Experience uh they

talked about the los Ninos the Little

Helpers that would come and I asked just

like Lucy I said I need some help what

can you help me with and I looked at my

hand

and

see

yeah if it gets something like this it's

a blood started to come out of

my hand and right in the middle of my

hand it was this blood came right out of

the palm and started dripping yeah oh

I'm bleeding you know it's like it

doesn't hurt

[Music]

I'm bleeding at that there and this

isn't even normal

yeah I mean it was like the whole

suffering stuff of what Catholics are

conditioned with and I mean it came

through and it was a Stigmata and I

looked at my other hand the same thing

was happening and I was going my God

this is I'm feeling this this

crucifixion you know saying in the Saint

Stephen and my name is Dana Martino and

all this martyrdom of subjective

you know on and on I mean you could I

could talk for another 30 minutes about

what that how meaningful that was to be

but um

talk about it you know you want an image

you want a vision you add the mushroom

God give me a vision they'll give you

one please oh yeah

yeah skinniest

[Music]

thing in the uh the legal aspect of this

thing you know we'll be talking

something about highly illegal you know

as far as the laws concerned how do you

handle it anybody that drives around

with their license places nmdmp you know

I wonder you you paralyzed that

obviously not um no I'm not paranoid

about it um

if they wanted me they should have come

a long time ago because I was much more

vulnerable then I sort of covered my ass

naturally if you speak about these

things you can't do anything

particularly illegal and I am

perhaps I'm foolish in the sense that

we're not I shouldn't be worried about

being arrested I should be worried about

being shot

if that's how they play the game then

I'm in big trouble because they'll just

come and shoot me and you too if you get

into this but if we actually have a

legal system that works then uh this is

called advocacy and it's not a crime

it's an exercise of the first fourth and

uh I don't know a couple of other

amendments to the Constitution uh Henry

David Thoreau you don't get more

American than that said that uh if you

are right you are a majority of one

and we live by majority rule my I don't

feel heroic I mean it's not false

modesty or anything I don't feel heroic

doing this this is really humdrum to me

I just could not behave any other way

because of what I've seen I mean this

transcends laws all that is uh it's

seen as Preposterous I mean there are

there are I believe in universal laws

you shouldn't kill people you shouldn't

lie to people

you shouldn't uh inject yourself between

lovers

most cultures I think recognize a set of

universal laws but

Thou shalt not smoke marijuana surely

the god of Mount Sinai has better things

to do than worry about that sort of

thing we have to create a new Option all

social progress is made by people Taking

Chances if I am an anomaly some kind of

dangerous sociopath

then my message will be swamped and lost

in the noise of the tumult of the world

because there are thousands of messages

out there if on the other hand this is a

great and important domain of truth then

they are crazy to try and repress it

because it cannot be repressed they have

tried to repress it oh

you know good for the safety why have

these progressors they sought to repress

it because there's something in the

western mind that is very nervous that

gets very nervous when you try to talk

about

the Bedrock of ontology

mcluhan talked about this he he met

great resistance and all he was saying

was that print had created certain kinds

of unconscious biases in society in

favor of uniformity linearity and like

that and and he was amazed at the

violence of the reaction against this

and he concluded that

those cultures that have evolved from

the phonetic alphabet are so removed

from the stuff of the world as opposed

to languages like Chinese or Mayan or

something like that where there is a

retention of the image in the written

language that the cultures descended

from the phonetic alphabet are extremely

paranoid about questions about the

nature of reality and that's what this

is really about the Psychedelic issue

does not relate to the drug issue at all

I mean in fact it's important to make

this point drugs

and psychedelics

are not two members of a family they are

antithetically opposed to each other the

pro-psychedelic position is an anti-drug

position now how can this be since we

are accustomed to thinking of

psychedelics as drugs well it's like

this what is it that we object to about

drugs and I think everybody can agree

maybe not everybody but most people can

agree we do have a drug problem I mean

if you live in the inner cities uh you

see people getting all twisted up behind

this stuff we have a drug problem

so what is it about drugs that we find

problematic well I think that what is

objectionable about drugs is that they

cause uh

unconscious

obsessive

destructive self or other Behavior

unconscious obsessive behavior is

intolerable because we are conscious

people accustomed to injecting choice

and meaning into our lives you cannot

have meaning if you do not have choice

this is why we don't have to spend any

time at all talking about whether the

world is predestined because if the

world is predestined then I'm not saying

what I'm saying because it's what I want

to say I'm saying what I'm saying

because I can't say anything else and

you're sitting there because you can't

not sit there so it makes the world very

dull and uninteresting

compulsive unexamined obsessive behavior

is the quintessence of of anti-human

Behavior it was bertolanfi the founder

of General systems theory who said

people are not machines

some of them are drugs which reinforce

obsessive be an unexamined and

self-destructive Behavior patterns well

what do psychedelics do they destroy

Behavior patterns destroy cultural

assumptions completely hold everything

up for grabs completely throw open the

possibility that reality could be any of

a number of ways that are not culturally

sanctioned so

so in that sense the psychedelics are

almost the answer to the drug problem

and the early the Early use of

psychedelics reported spectacular

progress with alcoholism well now see

the people who believe that alcoholism

is a disease

and I don't follow this literature

closely it seems to me this is a

Preposterous statement I mean a disease

you mean like influenza and smallpox and

AIDS alcoholism is a disease can you get

it if you don't practice safe sex or do

you have to wash your eating utensils it

isn't a disease what it is is it's a

failure of self-image and the reason LSD

in many cases had a tremendous impact on

alcoholic Behavior was because it just

showed people what they were doing said

this is you you're a drunk cheer a

burden to your family aboard to your

friends you smell bad and you're useless

how do you like it and system he said I

don't like it

I said well then stop drinking

that's what it is that's how

psychedelics cure addiction and nobody

when they talk about addiction nobody

ever talks about what is called

self-restraint

should go incredibly I don't remember

the name of him incredibly controversial

like alcoholism yeah that alcoholism

that's right yeah and the man take the

position that the last 30 or 40 years

when we've seen alcoholism as a as a

disease it's just you know more

from the medical models we need another

alternative of course AAA and

everybody's just up and arms about the

book well yeah

the name of the book is uh but it's by

cinegrid it's called heavy drinking the

myth of alcoholism disease it basically

discusses the fact that uh it's

eventually it's a rationalization to say

that it's a disease I mean there are

certain people I think they have certain

chemical reactions to alcohol but

they're the minority in that

um this is very important to me as well

because this is work that I'm interested

in and alcoholism has also touched my

families it has a lot of families and

yeah I think you know

has no there's no responsibility

involved you know and uh

a

their position their goal is not to

understand the nature of the universe

they're not in the philosophy business

they're trying to get people to stop

drinking so to maximize that goal I

think that they go far overboard first

of all all substances they say you if

you're an alcoholic then you must Force

swear everything I don't know how they

relate to Tobacco but see what you've

got to understand is

we are uh set up for addiction

it's just like language and cognition

and all of these other things we are the

animal which a dick other animals don't

dict and addiction is a way of relating

to the world we don't not only addict to

drugs we addict to each other to chunks

of territory

to behavior patterns like attaching all

enough to important exactly it's

attachments we attach to everything uh I

and it's very real it's physiological I

remember uh years and years ago

a woman left me for a homunculus and

um

I was uh

appalled and it it became it became uh I

mean I was like vomiting every four

hours could not sleep would burst into

tears in an appropriate situations of

which there were many in my life and uh

it would heroin withdrawal cannot be

worse than that I mean are you kidding

vomiting every four hours and uh

and then one night in the middle of the

night uh I I uh was just frantic because

I I felt like I when I was awake I felt

like I wanted to be asleep when I was

when I should have been sleeping I

couldn't sleep and I was just dragging

myself to classes I felt you know this

is crazy I should turn myself in but

they don't have crisis centers for

broken hearts what are you gonna do so

so then in the middle of one of these

bouts I I went to the medicine cabinet

and this woman who had left me had left

all these these pills there and I sorted

through all these pills and came up on a

small bottle of tranquilizers of a very

mild tranquilizer like valium or

something well I had never taken a

Valium so I said I'll take half

and I took it and uh the next morning or

a few hours later I went out to

breakfast and somebody came up and sat

at my table and said well how are you

coping uh since Hermione left you and I

said who

you know I

[Music]

jerk and and I it really gave me respect

for tranquilizers I mean I was appalled

I was appalled that something so real to

me so so much me

half the tab I didn't share you know let

him go and then I realized all the

people around me this is how they deal

with emotional crisis nobody wants to

feel anything I mean the first the

moment that an unpleasant emotion rears

its head people go take valium or or

something else and cut themselves off uh

from feeling we addict to people that's

the point of that story and when they

leave us Suddenly It's just like having

your heroin taken away and you become a

mad thing for months years sometimes I

mean I still vibrate from this event and

it was 15 years ago uh we addict to

territory This Is War our turf our land

now this arises again a consequence of

Agriculture before agriculture nobody

had land it land was something you

walked around on as you migrated behind

your herds once it was cognized as an

object and fixed upon they were ready to

knock the other guy's brains out for

setting foot on your territory we all do

this I mean we are addicted to caffeine

outrageous caffeine addictions money

sugar praise

television now this is the favorite one

to talk about because television is a

forerunner of very Insidious drugs to

come it's just the crudest and the first

but imagine if after World War II a drug

had been introduced into this country of

right thinking hard-working decent

Christian people such that 20 years

after its induction the average American

citizen would be spending six and a half

hours per day

involved in this drug that's the figure

for television consumption in this

country the average American watches six

and a half hours a day of TV it is an

electronic drug it is an obsessive

Behavior pattern an unconscious Behavior

pattern and a physically destructive

Behavior pattern I mean it's done more

for The Rebirth of hemorrhoid

Specialists than any other single force

in our society

so but people said well that's not a

drug That's Entertainment

six and a half hours a day of

entertainment you know before Electronic

media a person could regard themselves

as a great patron of uh let's say the

musical community and maybe they would

hear 12 Live musical performances a year

when they would go to a theater I mean

Pete how many how many people in

Beethoven how many experts on Beethoven

in his generation or the generation

following heard let's say the Ninth

Symphony more than several times in

their intellectual life because you know

you have to get a lot of people together

and cooperating to perform the Ninth

Symphony we to us the Ninth Symphony is

an object listen to it listen again

listen again we are able to turn

experience we are able to objectify

experience and then addict ourselves to

it well is this bad

how can it be bad if it is so written

into us uh I don't think it is bad I

think what we have to do is choose our

addictions choose our Behavior patterns

and the one can choose to be addicted to

punctuality I'm accused of this other

people are addicted to always being late

one can be addicted to

um

you know meaningless sexual encounters

[Music]

you mean uh because of the physiological

language well I think that's been much

overplayed I think uh I mean should we

not fall in love because we

pheromonially lock together with this

person and become a single unified set

of drives and goals the physiological

aspects of addiction have been I think

very strongly overdrawn I I smoke

cannabis every day at most opportunities

and have for years and years I mean

since I was 18 years old every once in a

while I stop

just to see what that's like

it's trivial it it's utterly easy all

that happens is a shift in Behavior

patterns I read more that's what happens

when I stop smoking uh cannabis and yet

I'm supposed to be breaking out into

cold sweats wandering aimlessly through

the streets of the city staring up at

lighted windows

yeah right so I think we give each other

too much permission to be weak in this

area what is never talked about in talk

about addiction is self-restraint I mean

For Heaven's Sake you know just take

hold of yourself

yeah responsibility and if you tell

people addiction is a disease addiction

is it's because you're black it's

because you're poor it's because you're

this it's because you're that you have

just given them a whole bunch of reasons

not to take responsibility for their own

situation and what is needed in these

addictive situations I think is the

shock of recognition uh

I believe see that if you don't take

drugs

you're unbearable

and there's no I can't think of a

society on Earth where people don't take

drugs that any of us would want to have

anything to do with I mean let's take

calvinist Geneva say I imagine that as

an example of a fairly of an environment

of moral rectitude I mean these people

did not wear bright colors didn't listen

to music never drank coffee never smoked

forget about alcohol sex for procreation

so forth and so on and they were are

paradigms of uh the male ego Frozen in

in place didactic

paternalistic uh uh all-knowing uh uh

filled with Hell Fire and Damnation

everything is seen in terms of a moral

Dimension that makes impossible demands

on the human animal uh rather I think

what we should realize is that somehow

our Evolution into a civilized

self-reflecting being is caught up in

these synergistic relationships that our

conscious mind has with various things

in the environment so that we should

choose our addictions now notice

that addictions uh to my mind and you

know you can argue with this if you want

by choosing extreme examples but

addictions to Natural substances are

harmless

let me name some natural substances that

you might disagree with me on this point

I think probably the strongest one would

be people would say well what about

opium

surely this is the scourge of mankind

actually opium was never a problem in

human populations until it was conceived

of as the problem by British colonial

policy makers who decided that they

could manipulate the opium trade to get

an entree into China uh

alcohol

was never a problem

particularly until the discovery of

distilled alcohol

and of course heroin is distilled opium

morphenal so

um sugar is a refined vegetable

substance it's every in every case it

has required the intercession of Science

and Technology to take harmless habits

and turn them into dangerous addictions

so that uh you know everybody has a

solution to the drug problem I think

what I would suggest is something called

the vegetable Drug Act

where you just say if it's a vegetable

it's not a drug this is was the position

until very recently in with British

common law in Canada mushrooms were

legal mushrooms aren't psilocybin

psilocybin is a refined chemical if it

is technology which allows us then to

create these super powerful addicting

substances and there will be more and

more of them Downstream you may be sure

so I think what we need to do is think

of human beings as Hardware as the the

computer if you will and drugs are forms

of software

and

the software that you run determines the

kind of functions that you can perform

if you if you'd run a distilled alcohol

software well then you take on the

Persona of the alcoholic I believe that

cannabis is probably the most harmless

and benign

drug around it it carries out this

feminizing that I talked about it lowers

the profile of the male ego instead of

wanting to Duke it out people just say

well if that's your thing

you know yeah

and that's what we need you know I mean

that practically boils down to what we

call tolerance

uh so I think that uh this disruption of

our relationships to

um

to psychoactive plants is what set us on

the long hard downward path into

neurosis and it began with agriculture

with the narrowing of our spectrum of

plant awareness from many many plants

down to uh the Rye the Oaths the barley

and it's interesting that them out of

this came the cultivation of I mean I

think beer preceded wine beer is an

older thing than wine that comes out of

the fact of having created surpluses

because the way the way beer was

discovered was through the fermentation

of grain that was stored

if you didn't have surpluses you would

never discover the psychoactive

properties of fermented grain it's very

interesting in Nepal the um

the uh nawari people have an alcoholic

beverage that when it's put in front of

you it looks like a bowl of granola it's

dry they pour it out of a sack into your

cup and you say you know this is beer

and then they come along with boiling

water and pour it over it and then you

get this foamy lightly fermented

contaminated Grain water

and to my mind that clearly is then how

fermentation of grains and production of

alcohol was established notice that it

was also the accumulation of surplus

from the agricultural adaptation that

creates the need for defense

because now you've got a surplus now you

have to guard your Surplus from

everybody who doesn't have any the other

thing that creation of surpluses caused

was uh the invention of barter and money

and this sort of thing because now you

have something that you can trade for

something that you don't have so all of

these adaptations also a nomadic people

cannot move a grain Surplus with them so

if your Harvest one year if you're a

semi-nomadic people

that the people who like in the Amazon

they plant things and then they leave

them and go away and they have like a

yearly peregrination and when they come

back to that place a year later there's

all this food ready for them well

imagine a nomadic people who were uh

doing that kind of quasi-agriculture

with cereal and then there's one year of

great weather and great rainfall and

when they arrive at their little wheat

patch so much wheat has been produced

that they can't move it they can't take

it with them so then they say well we in

we but we have food now so we don't have

to keep hunting so let's spend the

winter here and this Interruption of the

cycle of nomadism to deal with

unexpected surpluses

obviously spawned the idea in people's

minds well wouldn't it be great if we

had surpluses every year and then that

says well that won't happen if we're as

careless as we have been about our

sowing and harvesting but maybe if we're

very careful until the land and

carefully plant and do careful weeding

we'll have to stay here and weed but

then we'll get this tremendous payback

in the end so uh to my mind the

invention of agriculture broke our

relationship to the wild plants and the

lowered profile of the male ego and set

us on a path of Defending wealth

creating fortifications

supporting more specialization larger

populations so forth and so on and from

there to the present predicament it's

only a moment

uh

[Applause]

[Music]

uh then focusing on the fighting

protected that's right and also this

idea of our land

because you want to hang on to this good

serial drawing land so it's yours you

say and then you put a wall up around it

and then you defend it and so forth and

so on

well

um yeah

well I think that we're now things are

very far out of hand and we're caught up

now in the end game of history and that

we are going to uh have to create a way

out of this empath that is probably

going to mean a complete definite

redefining of who we are and how we rate

relate to each other and space and time

and life and death and it appears that

technology is now the thing that is

guiding us forward we are not being led

into the future by politicians

politicians are running frantically

along behind the wagon of History trying

to jump onto it what is leading us

what's pulling the cart is technology

and I think technology is the program of

realizing the Practical concerns of the

imagination and that really where we are

headed is the imagination it's a place I

don't know whether it's in solid-state

circuitry or in the bones of the planet

or in artificial arcologies in deep

space the future will figure out the

details but we are close enough to it

now that we can anticipate it it's what

the shamans always said was possible a

world of value and meaning uh lived in

the light of Nature and I think if we

can get through this narrow neck that

rationalism has imposed upon us and

overcome these poisonous

paternalistic

philosophies we will return that's why I

call it the archaic revival the myths of

the eternal return history is something

that you finish with as quickly as

possible and then return to the archaic

mode of Eternity and I think that's the

adventure that we're all caught up in

that's the agenda that the plants and

the planet have always had in front of

them it's just that we wandered away

from an awareness of what was happening

by deluding ourselves with our own uh

inflated self-image you know

man as master of woman and nature and

this distorted part of our self-image

has now become so dangerous to us that

we have to abandon it we have to draw

back from it and under that kind of

pressure I think we will so harking back

to another question the reason I do this

and the reason I don't feel any great

trepidation about it is because I

believe that

historical momentum is with us this is

what is destined to come to be we are

going to take control of Who We Are by

taking control of the physiological and

psychological foundations upon which the

self rests and that means the chemical

re-engineering of ourselves into the

state of endemic innocence that was lost

when we set out on the long trail of uh

you know The Sword and the hoe basically

[Music]

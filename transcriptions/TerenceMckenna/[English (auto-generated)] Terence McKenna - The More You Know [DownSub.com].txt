foreign

[Music]

fashion but it's simply that the act of

conscious self-inspection creates more

conscious people which create a more

conscious society which erodes the

possibility of the poisonous and toxic

effects of ideology this is what

psychedelics were and are about in terms

of their social position and their legal

position in society psychedelics are

illegal not because a love in government

is concerned that you may jump out of

the third story window psychedelics are

illegal because they dissolve opinion

structures and culturally laid down

models of behavior and information

processing they open you up to the

possibility that everything you know is

wrong and you know government and

Society Society spend a lot of money

educating you into being a loyal worker

Consumer Debt payer and citizen so if if

Anarchy is to have a meaning and I think

it is the great the great future for

Human Society because what it means is

only responsible human beings can exist

in an anarchistic Society to the degree

that people are responsible we will have

Anarchy and the reason America

I believe

historically has been so successful is

because it's really a place where you

can almost get away with anything

and if that is law

it's the uh if monolithic ideology the

uh throw a damper on that then cultural

momentum will pass through other

cultures and in fact to some degree I

see this coming we had a conversation

with the prominent politician recently

and he pointed out that uh Japan is now

the leading Western Country

it's a cultural crisis of some depth for

the ideals of the American Constitution

my brother is a brain scientist at the

National Institute of Mental Health in

Bethesda Maryland the crown jewel of

American brain science everybody there

is a Japanese graduate student doing

work on a two-year or three-year

scholarship

so uh

but I don't see or hear a new age voice

coming out of the Japanese I think this

is the cultural model

that the West

is uniquely able to promulgate and

perfect because it comes out of a

rejection of the tradition of scientific

materialism that we are responsible for

and that we are most sophisticated about

where for instance Japan has come fairly

recently to high-tech and mass

industrialization

so I I just basically want to leave you

with that the notion is that nature

which is the topological the

linguistically expressed topological

manifold of society is the an historical

object that is pulling us forward and

that when we actually cross into the

eschatology that appears fairly eminent

we will find it to have been anticipated

by the human relationship to Nature the

embedding of

psyche in nature through the mysterious

relationship mediated by language and

the key to uh to unfolding a sane

Society in my uh single humble opinion

is

an obligation to reason that clearly

distinguishes between reason and Science

and obligation to self-involvement in

immediate experience

and that means psychedelics sexuality

and what I call time but what I really

mean is a kind of deep literary

involvement with the felt presence

psychedelics sexuality and time to

empower the individual to make the

individual naturally responsible to

create then uh the basis for a caring

Global society that will transcend the

historical cultures as though we were

just moving very naturally out of winter

and into spring no apocalypse no

Millennium no Rescue by flying sauces no

Mayan return simply

the unfolding of understanding in a

program of mutual caring and

responsibility this is the highest

aspiration of the new age and I feel

that it is attainable

so let's break and then we'll have

questions

thank you very very much

[Laughter]

okay is there any kind of response

to this evening's talk wonderful yes in

my family life I can do a yoga practice

and I can maintain the certain amount of

purity of perspective true diet and

through meditation and things like that

and if I take this truck it makes it

very difficult for me to function in the

world because almost too much

information

[Music]

so your question is how do you integrate

safe and psychedelics into an ordinary

work that day existence

well

well I don't know that it is easily

integrated I mean I'm not sure whether

you mean you can't function while it's

happening or you can't function three

weeks afterwards

um

the

with the psychedelics it's not a matter

of high frequency I think but good trips

are usually good for plenty of

rumination for a long time the harder

the hit the longer you want to ponder it

before you go that route again

uh it isn't like a practice it isn't

like something you do daily it's more

like a uh unique Act of Courage that

arises out of the of the substratum of

ordinary daily existence whether it be

uh profane or or sacral

there really isn't an answer to your

question as long as we're part of the

worker antio or living in a society

which makes tremendous demands on us uh

it's going to be a problem the way to

take psychedelics is uh

you must have seen these t-shirts which

say I take drugs seriously

well that's the way to take them which

means rarely and that and that

substantially challenging Doses

and in an atmosphere where there are no

distractions and by that I mean other

people will say something different but

I mean no light

and no sound including music unless

you're a musician or you have some

special relationship to music but really

what you're trying to see is the

um

the the surface of the brain mind

interphase and to the degree that you

can create a situation of sensory

deprivation you will have a greater

expectation of succeeding some people

wouldn't dream of tripping without music

but I find that you know it becomes the

trip the whole thing then becomes about

that piece of music where in silence it

would have been equally ideally

interesting so it isn't the the early

model of the Psychedelic experience was

sort of that you eat an orange and look

at art books and listen to box Coral

preludes but that art historical

approach to it doesn't give enough

credit to the power of the substance I

mean it can lift the veil after veil in

silent Darkness to just catapult you

into endlessly undulating uh uh

tapestries of organic beauty and there

need be no sensory input in fact

shouldn't be for this to happen

you have a question I was running a

practical sort of

accepting like how do you take something

back it's sort of like going to a Magic

Kingdom and wanting to take back a gold

golden piece with you or a key or

something because I lose it you know

well I think I sort of touched on this

obliquely tonight that attention to

attention or paying attention to the

nuances of cognition

is a psychedelic way of being I mean if

any of you are familiar with Marcel prus

research to Tim Perdue he didn't take

drugs except for modnum and Valerian and

alcohol and absence and tobacco and

things like that so he was drug free and

he

he

managed to refine you know this art of

just the awareness of the tensions and

nuances in the moment for really what I

have come to believe about the

Psychedelic experience is that it is

simply a compressed instance of what we

call understanding

so that living psychedelically is trying

to live in an atmosphere of continuous

unfolding of understanding so that every

day you know more and see into things

with greater depth than you did before

and this is a process

it's a process of Education what the

Psychedelic experience is is it's the

process of education so compressed that

it has become a Cascade of actual visual

images

which rather than a kind of slow

unfoldment of linked perceptions but

really attention to attention and

appreciation of the immediate I always

think when this comes up of William

Blake's advice Blake was as you know a

great mystical Visionary English poet

who spoke with angels and had these

wonderful visions of of the Angelic

world and he was asked what was the

secret of his Angelic poetry and he said

attend the minute particulars

that's all just attend the minute

particulars that the and what he meant

was to focus attention in the moment not

to not to betray attention into

expectation born of abstraction or

regret born of misplaced assumption or

of remembrance born of boredom and

alienation in the moment but just to

attend the minute particulus it's a way

of training it's like yoga people think

that psychedelic

psychedelics are somehow the easy way

out this is what people think who

wouldn't dare dream of taking one and

it's not because it's the easy way out

it's because they sense that the reality

of it the reality of the fact of it and

the challenge of assimilating it I mean

uh

it's very real

it's not a metaphor it's not an analogy

it's not a dramatic reconstruction it is

not a Similac from it is not a model it

is the pith essence of the thing itself

it's uh it's real and I don't know how

many things can make that claim I mean

everyone has a different set of

experiences my own experiences have of

the other of the Transcendent naked

beauty of Truth have almost all entirely

come out of the Psychedelic realm or out

of involvement with the viscerality of

my emotions you know the death of my

mother the birth of my children

the act of marrying someone uh not uh

not else

but those

so I think it's it's about attending the

minute particulars as a kind of practice

it may not get you anywhere for several

years but if you attend the minute

particulars cultivate uh

an ongoing stream of self-description

telling yourself what is happening get

used to the idea that mind can penetrate

the immediate

surface of being and reveal the tactile

density of it as a manifold whose

measure cannot be immediately taken by

the eyes but it's deep it's connected

it's complex everything holds within

itself the anticipation and the memory

of everything else

yes

well it's hard to feel optimistic

sometimes it's uh

but it's an almost like an obligation

and I think there's enough evidence

around to support it uh

if Ronald Reagan

is going to begin the process of the

dismantling of strategic nuclear

stockpiles

then you know what would the civilized

and Humane political leader be doing in

this context so on one level I'm fairly

cynical I see you know uh people whose

major life's work has been mandatory and

bloody Rampage getting into the history

books as the great peacemakers

nevertheless I love the fact that the

constraints of the situation have forced

these clowns into this position

that's what I mean when I say you know

that no political group or no faction

has its hands on the tiller of history

there is an invisible hand which seems

to be channeling the life of these

institutions toward uh

what we deem Progressive ends

and

not not because these people have

converted to altruism and reason and

Sweetness in life but because it's a way

for them to save their political ass

so it has become expedient peace has

become politically expedient

consequently we shall have it I think in

a big hurry now granted it doesn't

address starvation

sexism

uh abuses of propaganda torture

uh all of these things but I I feel like

that there is a kind of a log Jam in

human Affairs that

formed in the late 60s where we all

looked over into the future and saw what

it was and the governing agencies

froze with Terror

and attempted to Halt the onrushing

momentum of the 20th century to not only

make psychedelic drugs illegal for the

public but to actually end scientific

research into them this is phenomenal

scientific research is supposed to be

freely pursued in any field that's the

banner under which science rides its

horse but apparently this doesn't apply

to hallucinogens uh

freezing all Dialogue on disarmament

freezing all Dialogue on the retraction

of Imperial the projection globally of

Imperial power and strategic stockpiles

all this was frozen in place in the late

60s and it's only now beginning to give

way the future has the momentum that no

institution can deny and the 25 years of

constipated dithering

that we have just come through has only

meant that now the transition into the

New Order will be that much more sudden

and that much more complete

um

so I guess I am uh I am optimistic uh

and the micro I see many causes for

pessimism but generally I think things

globally are working out fine now it may

be and I addressed this tonight in the

talk a little bit it may be that a sane

Humane and well said

uh world is coming into being but it may

not be led by the United States of

America we muscle bound with strategic

arsenals unable to produce things which

the rest of the world wants to buy in

entertaining a massive trade deficit

tolerant of

reactionary

pseudo-religious forms of political

crypto fascism we are uh did I hope no

one's offended by that we

are not exactly in the best position to

uh to lead the charge into this great

and glorious future a society with a

tradition of resource management like

Japan

is perhaps in a much better position

other than there are other problems

Japan speaks a language no one

understands it's going to be quite a

world if the power of the projection of

the Japanese cultural self-image is to

become so overwhelming that Japanese is

to become the dominant language of the

West although this is a possibility

certainly if any of you are familiar

with the fiction of William Gibson and

if you're not I urge it upon you this is

some of the most exciting science

fiction being written he pictures a

world where Japanese cultural dominance

I would say is a primary factor so yes

I'm optimistic we have to be it's the

only game in town and look at the

opportunities it's simply a matter of

insisting on human values garnered from

the felt experience of the moment and

holding back the toxic effects of

ideology in other words this Antarctic

prescription that I sort of put forth

this evening mainly holding back the

toxic effects of ideology because then

we can create a sane world if we just uh

recognize that pragmatism love for each

other and a reasonable amount of good

will will do quite nicely I think if the

shriller voices the ideologically driven

voices can be

made the day class setting not repressed

just simply recognize this tasteless

anything else yes

cultural devices

you have a different kind of time or

well yeah I've certainly I've reflected

on what it's like it's sort of a blank

screen on which to project your mind

what will it be like once we pass the

Omega point

I'm not really sure I mean it you can

take two approaches to it you can take

the sort of the deus ex machina approach

which means we can't know what it is

because it's going to be so wonderful

it's going to be like uh uh The Descent

of the flying saucers and we will all

March into the corrugated City and that

will be it or you can take a more

conservative approach and say well maybe

there's something going on in the trends

around us that we can extrapolate to try

and understand the world beyond the end

of time taking that approach what I

think is happening and it's been

happening for a long time and it's very

interesting is that culture

culture is another dimension

that uh

and perhaps properly so in the early

part of my talk I talked about how

culture had uh subsumed the position of

nature so that we had lost sight of

nature by erecting culture through

erecting these linguistic structures but

I noticed that uh and not only

linguistic structures but architectural

structures the infrastructure of our

society that is what culture is the way

we differ from the witoto is all the

stuff that we have bound into ideas and

excreted through our engineering

processes to surround ourselves with uh

this is

this

this Dimension which is culture is

becoming ever more it all inclusive at

the same time that it's also becoming

strangely enough ever more ethereal

ever less material a perfect example of

this I don't know how many of you are

are familiar with it but if you deal

with the Macintosh computer the

operating system of the math is the

genius of it and what makes it the best

in the biz is that it attempts to trick

you into believing that you're dealing

with ordinary three-dimensional space

you know you don't type in commands you

don't choose printed options you move in

a symbolic representation of

three-dimensional space well again to

mention William Gibson and his novels

what he imagines is simply a larger

version of this conventionalized uh

symbolic representation of

three-dimensional space so that you

enter in his novels his characters enter

into a world where the Bank of America

database is perceived as a huge red

rectangle hundreds of feet in height in

a certain spot in the memory of This

Global computer and and yes it's

cyberspace and near it is the memory

bank of Wells Fargo or something else so

that when you enter into cyberspace

ordinary reality is replaced by a

symbolic representation of the

informational content of ordinary

reality well this is in fact happening

uh it's happening at a very rapid rate

so the dimension which we call culture

which we have previously uh erected in

the three-dimensional world around us

through the intercession of what we call

manufacturing and architecture is very

rapidly being internalized and erected

as cyberspace this alternative Dimension

to ordinary three-dimensional space in

which our minds are able to move like

fish and water what I think lies Beyond

uh the end of time is

a very concrete realization of this

other dimension that's why things like

the time wave that I've developed and

some of these other projections run off

the scale the world beyond the end of

history is literally not mapable in the

lower order set of mappings that are

applicable to history so it is like

being downloaded into circuitry uh it's

possible to conceive of the entire human

species fitting into the area of a large

refrigerator

in in cyberspace so that the goal of

history is the creation of a mirror

image of culture in the cyberspatial

dimension so that culture in the

dimension of nature sure can be slowly

retracted

slowly retracted into the compressed

quintessence you can almost think of

this as an alchemical process we're

talking about forging a philosopher's

stone out of a hyperdimensional medium

which is composed of energy and language

and into which we can all cast ourselves

at will it is you know Plato said if God

didn't exist man would invent him her if

well it may well be that uh

the Pilot's feet

Pilot chair of the Flying Saucer is

empty it awaits mankind

it is the condensed expectation of

complete interpenetration of all of us

through each other and our cultural

artifact in a mode that we cannot even

imagine at an earlier talk it will here

a couple of years ago I did a talk

called shedding the monkey which I

talked about dropping uh the primate

image that is projected on to the human

soul through through the accidents of

biological evolution that as we take

control of our genetic Heritage as we

take control of the process of

manufacturing culture we are going to

become what we dream we are

and we have never really explored

consciously what it is we dream we are

but very shortly this will become a

major part of the cultural agenda

because we are going to be able to do

anything

and uh

with that kind of power

again returning to the theme of the

evening I think we have to answer

ourselves in nature so sort of my

Apostle

apotheosis or my vision of of how this

should come to be is that everyone is

given uh you know their own 500 Acres of

Paradise in the chin

and that is your heritage your space

your right place to be and out of the

mellowness which accrues only to the

very wealthy

which we will then each and every one of

us fall into that category we will be

able to return to the dimension of The

Limited pie

and very decorously and thoughtfully

apportion it out in a sane and rational

matter so manly so uh

and it's very very tricky see this Rush

toward the ability to completely realize

the self-image in hyperspace my mother

used to say to me when I was a small

child if wishes were horses Beggars

would ride and I think that that's the

dream to turn wishes into horses that

Beggars May ride and it's that world

where we each get our own horde or when

our ship comes in that lies beyond the

historical Dimension because it's where

we in effect each becomes all and then

is freed into the imagination of the

oversoul to create whatever capsules in

the imagination seem most pleasing it's

the Triumph of Art

art

in the imagination and reverence for

nature in the uh in the placental

Dimension which is the life support

system for this fantastic

Indulgence in the uh in the expression

of the imagination yeah

the opposite city of ideology

I'm an educator educational children

and I just like you to address what we

can do or what your idea is about what

Society can do so that we don't have to

undo it

at some point I mean and most of us here

has to kind of undo what we went through

as children and public education anyway

so that we should at least come to some

level of awareness or uh

deceitfulness within ourselves

we see positive side of it if you're uh

well in Hawaii this past year we

homeschooled our children and we also

coincidentally rented off the space from

a major company which creates

homeschooling curriculums and on their

letterhead they had the motto you are

your child's best teacher

and we found out how hard it is to live

up to that ideal and yet in a way we

also found out how rewarding it was to

attempt it when we returned to Northern

California our children will go to

Public School uh

I think basically you have to just you

have to not

leave it up to the school

you have to check in on what's going on

and to input into the process I don't I

don't feel that I can give a very deep

answer to this I think it's one of the

most perplexing problems one thing I

think that's terribly wrong with

education is that there is no sense of

History

instilled in people and uh history has

almost as bad a rap on it as mathematics

and yet these are the two modes of

thought which I think would do the most

to Anchor us because they both are about

uh different forms of grounding one

grounds in Eternal demonstrable

principles

mathematics and the other

uh dissipates amnesia

it's a very weird thing that somebody

can't tell you isn't quite clear on

whether event X happened in the 13th or

the 16th century

I mean after all 13th 16th 19 how would

you like to be uh you know so

imprecisely perceived in somebody's mind

that they couldn't get within 300 years

of where you lived and died uh so the

lack of a sense of History makes us

really pray to manipulation

that's why I I am cynical enough to

believe that the de-emphasizing of

History that's gone on in American

Education over the past 30 years is

almost the equivalent of a plot the

notion you know even as recently as when

I graduated from the University and it

took me 12 years so I didn't graduate

until 75 but the idea was that if you

went to a university you emerged a a

liberal gentle person

in well-informed on the accomplishments

of your culture its history the

aspiration its ways of governing itself

it's ways of resolving conflict and so

on now I think people in mer these

things have become gigantic trade

schools and you are not you are expected

to learn to do a job and when not doing

your job malls have been provided for

you to shop in and tell them 240

channels of garbage have been piped into

your home for you to keep up on what it

is that is of Quran to go out and buy

and this creation of this historyless

uh mindless consumerist person at the

expense of the demographic of the ideal

of the democratically informed citizen

is going to rest great happen in our

society a people

often compliment me on you know the my

enchanting command of these various

subjects and so forth and so on and I'm

amazed because what's being sold to you

here tonight ladies and gentlemen is

nothing more than the fruits of a

liberal college education you know you

go to college you learn about gnosticism

platonic philosophy or you once did but

no more apparently so it can be sold as

the most far out cringy thing in the new

ways

this is this is this this is amnesia on

on quite a scale

so uh

and the other thing I would say in

answer to your question about education

is uh is

separating physical culture from

competition

that the notion of physical culture and

by that I mean gym class

and competition is one of the I mean I'm

I'm now I feel the bio Rising this is uh

we're talking serious here now but

saving people from the grief of PE is I

think in a major way to heal the culture

when when we were living in Hawaii

have asked our son how did he think of

himself and he said he thought of

himself as an artist and an athlete

and I thought that this was just an

amazing breakthrough because I thought

of myself as uh uh you know a sort of 95

pound weakling and the notion that my

son should be physically just like I was

at his age and yet conceive of himself

as an athlete and have this balanced

view of our athlete

junior scientists and so forth meant we

must be doing something right and what

it is is stressing physical culture

being in the ocean hiking running

skateboarding biking all these things

without the notion of males crashing

against each other for the purposes of

racking up points with females and

Elders to lay the groundwork for the

whole imposition of the alpha male

primate hierarchy that makes Society

such a man

foreign
